24429156	Genetic variants associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis susceptibility and mortality : a genome - wide association study .|BACKGROUND : Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) is a devastating disease that probably involves several genetic loci .|Several rare genetic variants and one common single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) of MUC5B have been associated with the disease .|Our aim was to identify additional common variants associated with susceptibility and ultimately mortality in IPF .|METHODS : First , we did a three - stage genome - wide association study ( GWAS ) : stage one was a discovery GWAS ; and stages two and three were independent case - control studies .|DNA samples from European - American patients with IPF meeting standard criteria were obtained from several US centres for each stage .|Data for European - American control individuals for stage one were gathered from the database of genotypes and phenotypes ; additional control individuals were recruited at the University of Pittsburgh to increase the number .|For controls in stages two and three , we gathered data for additional sex - matched European - American control individuals who had been recruited in another study .|DNA samples from patients and from control individuals were genotyped to identify SNPs associated with IPF .|SNPs identified in stage one were carried forward to stage two , and those that achieved genome - wide significance ( p < 5 x 10 ( - 8 ) ) in a meta - analysis were carried forward to stage three .|Three case series with follow - up data were selected from stages one and two of the GWAS using samples with follow - up data .|Mortality analyses were done in these case series to assess the SNPs associated with IPF that had achieved genome - wide significance in the meta - analysis of stages one and two .|Finally , we obtained gene - expression profiling data for lungs of patients with IPF from the Lung Genomics Research Consortium and analysed correlation with SNP genotypes .|FINDINGS : In stage one of the GWAS ( 542 patients with IPF , 542 control individuals matched one - by - one to cases by genetic ancestry estimates ) , we identified 20 loci .|Six SNPs reached genome - wide significance in stage two ( 544 patients , 687 control individuals ) : three TOLLIP SNPs ( rs111521887 , rs5743894 , rs5743890 ) and one MUC5B SNP ( rs35705950 ) at 11p15 . 5 ; one MDGA2 SNP ( rs7144383 ) at 14q21 . 3 ; and one SPPL2C SNP ( rs17690703 ) at 17q21 . 31 .|Stage three ( 324 patients , 702 control individuals ) confirmed the associations for all these SNPs , except for rs7144383 .|Linkage disequilibrium between the MUC5B SNP ( rs35705950 ) and TOLLIP SNPs ( rs111521887 [ r ( 2 ) = 0 07 ] , rs5743894 [ r ( 2 ) = 0 16 ] , and rs5743890 [ r ( 2 ) = 0 01 ] ) was low .|683 patients from the GWAS were included in the mortality analysis .|Individuals who developed IPF despite having the protective TOLLIP minor allele of rs5743890 carried an increased mortality risk ( meta - analysis with fixed - effect model : hazard ratio 1 72 [ 95 % CI 1 24 - 2 38 ] ; p = 0 0012 ) .|TOLLIP expression was decreased by 20 % in individuals carrying the minor allele of rs5743890 ( p = 0 097 ) , 40 % in those with the minor allele of rs111521887 ( p = 3 0 x 10 ( - 4 ) ) , and 50 % in those with the minor allele of rs5743894 ( p = 2 93 x 10 ( - 5 ) ) compared with homozygous carriers of common alleles for these SNPs .|INTERPRETATION : Novel variants in TOLLIP and SPPL2C are associated with IPF susceptibility .|One novel variant of TOLLIP , rs5743890 , is also associated with mortality .|These associations and the reduced expression of TOLLIP in patients with IPF who carry TOLLIP SNPs emphasise the importance of this gene in the disease .|FUNDING : National Institutes of Health ;

24516540	Characterization of an Italian founder mutation in the RING - finger domain of BRCA1 .|The identification of founder mutations in cancer predisposing genes is important to improve risk assessment in geographically defined populations , since it may provide specific targets resulting in cost - effective genetic testing .|Here , we report the characterization of the BRCA1 c . 190T > C ( p . Cys64Arg ) mutation , mapped to the RING - finger domain coding region , that we detected in 43 hereditary breast / ovarian cancer ( HBOC ) families , for the large part originating from the province of Bergamo ( Northern Italy ) .|Haplotype analysis was performed in 21 families , and led to the identification of a shared haplotype extending over three BRCA1 - associated marker loci ( 0 . 4 cM ) .|Using the DMLE + 2 . 2 software program and regional population demographic data , we were able to estimate the age of the mutation to vary between 3 , 100 and 3 , 350 years old .|Functional characterization of the mutation was carried out at both transcript and protein level .|Reverse transcriptase - PCR analysis on lymphoblastoid cells revealed expression of full length mRNA from the mutant allele .|A green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) - fragment reassembly assay showed that the p . Cys64Arg substitution prevents the binding of the BRCA1 protein to the interacting protein BARD1 , in a similar way as proven deleterious mutations in the RING - domain .|Overall , 55 of 83 ( 66 % ) female mutation carriers had a diagnosis of breast and / or ovarian cancer .|Our observations indicate that the BRCA1 c . 190T > C is a pathogenic founder mutation present in the Italian population .|Further analyses will evaluate whether screening for this mutation can be suggested as an effective strategy for the rapid identification of at - risk individuals in the Bergamo area .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	58-63	21-22	rs80357064	c . 190T > C|p .

24529773	Is sudden unexplained nocturnal death syndrome in Southern China a cardiac sodium channel dysfunction disorder ?|Sudden unexplained nocturnal death syndrome ( SUNDS ) remains an enigma to both forensic pathologists and physicians .|Previous epidemiological , clinical , and pilot genetic studies have implicated that SUNDS is most likely a disease allelic to Brugada syndrome ( BrS ) .|We have performed postmortem genetic testing to address the spectrum and role of genetic abnormalities in the SCN5A - encoded cardiac sodium channel and its several associated proteins in SUNDS victims from Southern China .|Genomic DNA extracted from the blood samples of 123 medico - legal autopsy - negative SUNDS cases and 104 sex - , age - and ethnic - matched controls from Southern China underwent comprehensive amino acid coding region mutational analysis for the BrS associated genes SCN5A , SCN1B , SCN2B , SCN3B , SCN4B , MOG1 , and GPD1 - L using PCR and direct sequencing .|We identified a total of 7 unique ( 4 novel ) putative pathogenic mutations ( all in SCN5A ; V95I , R121Q [ 2 cases ] , R367H , R513H , D870H , V1764D , and S1937F ) in 8 / 123 ( 6 . 5 % ) SUNDS cases .|Three SCN5A mutations ( V95I , R121Q , and R367H ) have been previously implicated in BrS .|An additional 8 cases hosted rare variants of uncertain clinical significance ( SCN5A : V1098L , V1202M , R1512W ; SCN1B : V138I [ 3 cases ] , T189M [ 2 cases ] ; SCN3B : A195T ) .|There were no non - synonymous mutations found in SCN2B , SCN4B , MOG1 , or GPD1 - L .|This first comprehensive genotyping for SCN5A and related genes in the Chinese Han population with SUNDS discovered 13 mutations , 4 of them novel , in 16 cases , which suggests cardiac sodium channel dysfunction might account for the pathogenesis of 7 - 13 % of SUNDS in Southern China .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	181-182	18-21	rs199473054	V95I|V95I	ProteinMutation	181:217	182:218	5:6	D003643	nocturnal death syndrome|nocturnal death syndrome	Disease	3:18	6:21	0:1	6331	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	183-184	18-21	rs199473058	R121Q|R121Q	ProteinMutation	183:219	184:220	5:6	D003643	nocturnal death syndrome|nocturnal death syndrome	Disease	3:18	6:21	0:1	6331	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	189-190	18-21	rs28937318	R367H|R367H	ProteinMutation	189:222	190:223	5:6	D003643	nocturnal death syndrome|nocturnal death syndrome	Disease	3:18	6:21	0:1	6331	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	191-192	18-21	rs397517951	R513H	ProteinMutation	191	192	5	D003643	nocturnal death syndrome|nocturnal death syndrome	Disease	3:18	6:21	0:1	6331	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	245-246	18-21	rs199473191	V1098L	ProteinMutation	245	246	7	D003643	nocturnal death syndrome|nocturnal death syndrome	Disease	3:18	6:21	0:1	6331	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	247-248	18-21	rs375509048	V1202M	ProteinMutation	247	248	7	D003643	nocturnal death syndrome|nocturnal death syndrome	Disease	3:18	6:21	0:1	6331	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	249-250	18-21	rs137854602	R1512W	ProteinMutation	249	250	7	D003643	nocturnal death syndrome|nocturnal death syndrome	Disease	3:18	6:21	0:1	6331	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	253-254	18-21	rs72558029	V138I	ProteinMutation	253	254	7	D003643	nocturnal death syndrome|nocturnal death syndrome	Disease	3:18	6:21	0:1	6324	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	259-260	18-21	rs2305748	T189M	ProteinMutation	259	260	7	D003643	nocturnal death syndrome|nocturnal death syndrome	Disease	3:18	6:21	0:1	6324	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	267-268	18-21	rs375755770	A195T	DNAMutation	267	268	7	D003643	nocturnal death syndrome|nocturnal death syndrome	Disease	3:18	6:21	0:1	55800	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	181-182	73-75	rs199473054	V95I|V95I	ProteinMutation	181:217	182:218	5:6	D030342	channel dysfunction disorder|genetic abnormalities	Disease	12:73	15:75	0:3	6331	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	183-184	73-75	rs199473058	R121Q|R121Q	ProteinMutation	183:219	184:220	5:6	D030342	channel dysfunction disorder|genetic abnormalities	Disease	12:73	15:75	0:3	6331	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	189-190	73-75	rs28937318	R367H|R367H	ProteinMutation	189:222	190:223	5:6	D030342	channel dysfunction disorder|genetic abnormalities	Disease	12:73	15:75	0:3	6331	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	191-192	73-75	rs397517951	R513H	ProteinMutation	191	192	5	D030342	channel dysfunction disorder|genetic abnormalities	Disease	12:73	15:75	0:3	6331	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	245-246	73-75	rs199473191	V1098L	ProteinMutation	245	246	7	D030342	channel dysfunction disorder|genetic abnormalities	Disease	12:73	15:75	0:3	6331	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	247-248	73-75	rs375509048	V1202M	ProteinMutation	247	248	7	D030342	channel dysfunction disorder|genetic abnormalities	Disease	12:73	15:75	0:3	6331	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	249-250	73-75	rs137854602	R1512W	ProteinMutation	249	250	7	D030342	channel dysfunction disorder|genetic abnormalities	Disease	12:73	15:75	0:3	6331	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	253-254	73-75	rs72558029	V138I	ProteinMutation	253	254	7	D030342	channel dysfunction disorder|genetic abnormalities	Disease	12:73	15:75	0:3	6324	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	259-260	73-75	rs2305748	T189M	ProteinMutation	259	260	7	D030342	channel dysfunction disorder|genetic abnormalities	Disease	12:73	15:75	0:3	6324	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	267-268	73-75	rs375755770	A195T	DNAMutation	267	268	7	D030342	channel dysfunction disorder|genetic abnormalities	Disease	12:73	15:75	0:3	55800	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	181-182	52-56	rs199473054	V95I|V95I	ProteinMutation	181:217	182:218	5:6	D053840	allelic to Brugada syndrome	Disease	52	56	2	6331	None	1:VDA:2	R2L	CROSS	183-184	52-56	rs199473058	R121Q|R121Q	ProteinMutation	183:219	184:220	5:6	D053840	allelic to Brugada syndrome	Disease	52	56	2	6331	None	1:VDA:2	R2L	CROSS	189-190	52-56	rs28937318	R367H|R367H	ProteinMutation	189:222	190:223	5:6	D053840	allelic to Brugada syndrome	Disease	52	56	2	6331	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	191-192	52-56	rs397517951	R513H	ProteinMutation	191	192	5	D053840	allelic to Brugada syndrome	Disease	52	56	2	6331	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	245-246	52-56	rs199473191	V1098L	ProteinMutation	245	246	7	D053840	allelic to Brugada syndrome	Disease	52	56	2	6331	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	247-248	52-56	rs375509048	V1202M	ProteinMutation	247	248	7	D053840	allelic to Brugada syndrome	Disease	52	56	2	6331	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	249-250	52-56	rs137854602	R1512W	ProteinMutation	249	250	7	D053840	allelic to Brugada syndrome	Disease	52	56	2	6331	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	253-254	52-56	rs72558029	V138I	ProteinMutation	253	254	7	D053840	allelic to Brugada syndrome	Disease	52	56	2	6324	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	259-260	52-56	rs2305748	T189M	ProteinMutation	259	260	7	D053840	allelic to Brugada syndrome	Disease	52	56	2	6324	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	267-268	52-56	rs375755770	A195T	DNAMutation	267	268	7	D053840	allelic to Brugada syndrome	Disease	52	56	2	55800	None

analyses were conducted on four GWASs and four replication studies including a total of 11 506 cases and 32 678 controls , and on the subset of studies that investigated associations for revised American Fertility Society ( rAFS ) Stage III / IV including 2859 cases .|The datasets included 9039 cases and 27 343 controls of European ( Australia , Belgium , Italy , UK , USA ) and 2467 cases and 5335 controls of Japanese ancestry .|Fixed and Han and Elkin random - effects models , and heterogeneity statistics ( Cochran 's Q test ) , were used to investigate the evidence of the nine reported genome - wide significant loci across datasets and populations .|RESULTS : Meta - analysis showed that seven out of nine loci had consistent directions of effect across studies and populations , and six out of nine remained genome - wide significant ( P < 5 x 10 ( - 8 ) ) , including rs12700667 on 7p15 . 2 ( P = 1 . 6 x 10 ( -

10 ) ) and rs13394619 in GREB1 ( P = 4 . 5 x 10 ( - 8 ) ) .|In addition to the six loci , two showed borderline genome - wide significant associations with Stage III / IV endometriosis , including rs1250248 in FN1 ( P = 8 x 10 ( - 8 ) ) and rs4141819 on 2p14 ( P = 9 . 2 x 10 ( - 8 ) ) .|Two independent inter - genic loci , rs4141819 and rs6734792 on chromosome 2 , showed significant evidence of heterogeneity across datasets ( P < 0 . 005 ) .|Eight of the nine loci had stronger effect sizes among Stage III / IV cases , implying that they are likely to be implicated in the development of moderate to severe , or ovarian , disease .|While three out of nine loci were inter -

25392328	A new risk variant for multiple sclerosis at the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus associates with intrathecal IgG , IgM index and oligoclonal bands .|BACKGROUND : Recent findings have shown a correlation between the intrathecal IgG index and variants at the immunoglobulin heavy chain ( IGHC ) locus in patients with multiple sclerosis ( MS ) .|OBJECTIVES : The objective of this paper is to analyse the association of the locus with MS susceptibility and its relationship with intrathecal immunoglobulin ( Ig ) parameters .|METHODS : We genotyped the rs11621145 variant , located at the IGHC locus , in 2726 patients with MS and 2133 healthy controls .|Associations of intrathecal IgG and IgM indexes with rs11621145 were analysed by linear regression analysis in 538 MS patients .|RESULTS : We found that rs11621145 showed statistically significant evidence for association with susceptibility to MS ( odds ratio = 0 . 69 , p = 1 . 053E - 09 ) , though validation of this result in additional cohorts would be desirable .|We confirmed the association between the IgG index and the rs11621145 ( p = 6 . 85E - 07 , Beta = 0 . 207 ) .|Furthermore , rs11621145 was inversely correlated with IgM index ( p = 7 . 24E - 04 , Beta = - 0 . 277 ) , and therefore marks a decreased likelihood of presenting IgM oligoclonal bands ( odds ratio = 0 . 38 , p = 2 . 35E - 06 ) .|CONCLUSIONS : Our results suggest that the polymorphism of the IGHC locus could be altering the switching of the Ig isotype in B cells and it may be interfering with T - dependent and T - independent antibody responses .	1:VDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	135-136	127-128	rs11621145	rs11621145|rs11621145|rs11621145|rs11621145|rs11621145	SNP	91:118:135:185:204	92:119:136:186:205	3:4:5:6:7	D009103	multiple sclerosis|multiple sclerosis|MS|MS|MS|MS|MS	Disease	5:51:54:73:104:127:145	7:53:55:74:105:128:146	0:1:1:2:3:4:5	None	None

25786344	IKs Gain - and Loss - of - Function in Early - Onset Lone Atrial Fibrillation .|INTRODUCTION : Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) is the most frequent cardiac arrhythmia .|The potassium current IKs is essential for cardiac repolarization .|Gain - of - function mutation in KCNQ1 , the gene encoding the pore - forming alpha - subunit of the IKs channel ( KV 7 . 1 ) , was the first ion channel dysfunction to be associated with familial AF .|We hypothesized that early - onset lone AF is associated with a high prevalence of mutations in KCNQ1 .|METHODS AND RESULTS : We bidirectionally sequenced the entire coding sequence of KCNQ1 in 209 unrelated patients with early - onset lone AF ( < 40 years ) and investigated the identified mutations functionally in a heterologous expression system .|We found 4 nonsynonymous KCNQ1 mutations ( A46T , R195W , A302V , and R670K ) in 4 unrelated patients ( 38 , 31 , 39 , and 36 years , respectively ) .|None of the mutations were present in the control group ( n = 416 alleles ) .|No other mutations were found in genes previously associated with AF .|The mutations A46T , R195W , and A302V have previously been associated with long - QT syndrome .|In line with previous reports , we found A302V to display a pronounced loss - of - function of the IKs current , while the other mutants exhibited a gain - of - function phenotype .|CONCLUSIONS : Mutations in the IKs channel leading to gain - of - function have previously been described in familial AF , yet this is the first time a loss - of - function mutation in KCNQ1 is associated with early - onset lone AF .|These findings suggest that both gain - of - function and loss - of - function of cardiac potassium currents enhance the susceptibility to AF .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	208-209	204-205	rs199473671	A46T|A46T	DNAMutation	150:208	151:209	6:9	D001281	Atrial Fibrillation|Atrial fibrillation|AF|AF|AF|AF|AF|AF|AF|AF	Disease	14:19:22:82:91:125:204:280:304:330	16:21:23:83:92:126:205:281:305:331	0:1:1:3:4:5:8:11:11:12	3784	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	210-211	204-205	rs150172393	R195W|R195W	ProteinMutation	152:210	153:211	6:9	D001281	Atrial Fibrillation|Atrial fibrillation|AF|AF|AF|AF|AF|AF|AF|AF	Disease	14:19:22:82:91:125:204:280:304:330	16:21:23:83:92:126:205:281:305:331	0:1:1:3:4:5:8:11:11:12	3784	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	213-214	204-205	rs193922365	A302V|A302V|A302V	ProteinMutation	154:213:232	155:214:233	6:9:10	D001281	Atrial Fibrillation|Atrial fibrillation|AF|AF|AF|AF|AF|AF|AF|AF	Disease	14:19:22:82:91:125:204:280:304:330	16:21:23:83:92:126:205:281:305:331	0:1:1:3:4:5:8:11:11:12	3784	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	157-158	125-126	rs763389576	R670K	ProteinMutation	157	158	6	D001281	Atrial Fibrillation|Atrial fibrillation|AF|AF|AF|AF|AF|AF|AF|AF	Disease	14:19:22:82:91:125:204:280:304:330	16:21:23:83:92:126:205:281:305:331	0:1:1:3:4:5:8:11:11:12	3784	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	150-151	28-30	rs199473671	A46T|A46T	DNAMutation	150:208	151:209	6:9	D001145	cardiac arrhythmia	Disease	28	30	1	3784	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	152-153	28-30	rs150172393	R195W|R195W	ProteinMutation	152:210	153:211	6:9	D001145	cardiac arrhythmia	Disease	28	30	1	3784	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	154-155	28-30	rs193922365	A302V|A302V|A302V	ProteinMutation	154:213:232	155:214:233	6:9:10	D001145	cardiac arrhythmia	Disease	28	30	1	3784	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	157-158	28-30	rs763389576	R670K	ProteinMutation	157	158	6	D001145	cardiac arrhythmia	Disease	28	30	1	3784	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	150-151	75-77	rs199473671	A46T|A46T	DNAMutation	150:208	151:209	6:9	D020294	channel dysfunction	Disease	75	77	3	3784	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	152-153	75-77	rs150172393	R195W|R195W	ProteinMutation	152:210	153:211	6:9	D020294	channel dysfunction	Disease	75	77	3	3784	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	154-155	75-77	rs193922365	A302V|A302V|A302V	ProteinMutation	154:213:232	155:214:233	6:9:10	D020294	channel dysfunction	Disease	75	77	3	3784	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	157-158	75-77	rs763389576	R670K	ProteinMutation	157	158	6	D020294	channel dysfunction	Disease	75	77	3	3784	None	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	208-209	219-223	rs199473671	A46T|A46T	DNAMutation	150:208	151:209	6:9	D008133	long - QT syndrome	Disease	219	223	9	3784	None	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	210-211	219-223	rs150172393	R195W|R195W	ProteinMutation	152:210	153:211	6:9	D008133	long - QT syndrome	Disease	219	223	9	3784	None	1:VDA:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	213-214	219-223	rs193922365	A302V|A302V|A302V	ProteinMutation	154:213:232	155:214:233	6:9:10	D008133	long - QT syndrome	Disease	219	223	9	3784	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	157-158	219-223	rs763389576	R670K	ProteinMutation	157	158	6	D008133	long - QT syndrome	Disease	219	223	9	3784	None

25961909	Distinct Impact of Two Keratin Mutations Causing Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex on Keratinocyte Adhesion and Stiffness .|Keratin filaments constitute the major component of the epidermal cytoskeleton from heterodimers of type I and type II keratin subunits .|Missense mutations in keratin 5 or keratin 14 , highly expressed in the basal epidermis , cause the severe skin blistering disease epidermolysis bullosa simplex ( EBS ) in humans by rendering the keratin cytoskeleton sensitive to mechanical stress ; yet , the mechanisms by which individual mutations cause cell fragility are incompletely understood .|Here , we compared the K14p . Arg125Pro with the K5p . Glu477Asp mutation , both giving rise to severe generalized EBS , by stable expression in keratin - free keratinocytes .|This revealed distinctly different effects on keratin cytoskeletal organization , in agreement with in vivo observations , thus validating the cell system .|Although the K14p . Arg125Pro mutation led to impaired desmosomes , downregulation of desmosomal proteins , and weakened epithelial sheet integrity upon shear stress , the K5p . Glu477Asp mutation did not impair these functions , although causing EBS with squamous cell carcinoma in vivo .|Atomic force microscopy demonstrated that K14 mutant cells were even less resistant against deformation compared with keratin - free keratinocytes .|Thus , a keratin mutation causing EBS compromises cell stiffness to a greater extent than the lack of keratins .|Finally , re - expression of K14 in K14 mutant cells did not rescue the above defects .|Collectively , our findings have implications for EBS therapy approaches .	1:VDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	113-114	97-100	rs58330629	p .

26006263	Recent Positive Selection Drives the Expansion of a Schizophrenia Risk Nonsynonymous Variant at SLC39A8 in Europeans .|Natural selection has played important roles in optimizing complex human adaptations .|However , schizophrenia poses an evolutionary paradox during human evolution , as the illness has strongly negative effects on fitness , but persists with a prevalence of ~0 . 5 % across global populations .|Recent studies have identified numerous risk variations in diverse populations , which might be able to explain the stable and high rate of schizophrenia morbidity in different cultures and regions , but the questions about why the risk alleles derived and maintained in human gene pool still remain unsolved .|Here , we studied the evolutionary pattern of a schizophrenia risk variant rs13107325 ( P < 5 . 0 x 10 ( - 8 ) in Europeans ) in the SLC39A8 gene .|We found the SNP is monomorphic in Asians and Africans with risk ( derived ) T - allele totally absent , and further evolutionary analyses showed the T - allele has experienced recent positive selection in Europeans .|Subsequent exploratory analyses implicated that the colder environment in Europe was the likely selective pressures , ie , when modern humans migrated " out of Africa " and moved to Europe mainland ( a colder and cooler continent than Africa ) , new alleles derived due to positive selection and protected humans from risk of hypertension and also helped them adapt to the cold environment .|The hypothesis was supported by our pleiotropic analyses with hypertension and energy intake as well as obesity in Europeans .|Our data thus provides an intriguing example to illustrate a possible mechanism for maintaining schizophrenia risk alleles in the human gene pool , and further supported that schizophrenia is likely a product caused by pleiotropic effect during human evolution .	1:VDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	126-127	123-124	rs13107325	rs13107325	SNP	126	127	4	D012559	Schizophrenia|schizophrenia|schizophrenia|schizophrenia|schizophrenia|schizophrenia	Disease	8:31:87:123:285:298	9:32:88:124:286:299	0:2:3:4:8:8	64116	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	126-127	240-241	rs13107325	rs13107325	SNP	126	127	4	D006973	hypertension|hypertension	Disease	240:260	241:261	6:7	64116	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	126-127	267-268	rs13107325	rs13107325	SNP	126	127	4	D009765	obesity	Disease	267	268	7	64116	None
26010696	A Novel Mutation in ELOVL4 Leading to Spinocerebellar Ataxia ( SCA ) With the Hot Cross Bun Sign but Lacking Erythrokeratodermia : A Broadened Spectrum of SCA34 .|IMPORTANCE : Although mutations in 26 causative genes have been identified in the spinocerebellar ataxias ( SCAs ) , the causative genes in a substantial number of families with SCA remain unidentified .|OBJECTIVE : To identify the causative gene of SCA in 2 Japanese families with distinct neurological symptoms and radiological presentations .|DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS : Clinical genetic study at a referral center of 11 members from 2 Japanese families , which started in 1997 .|MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES : Results of neurological examinations and radiological evaluations .|The causative mutation was identified using genome - wide linkage analysis and next - generation sequencing .|RESULTS : Affected members ( 9 of 11 members [ 81 . 8 % ] ) showed slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia ( all 9 members [ 100 % ] ) , ocular movement disturbance ( all 9 members [ 100 % ] ) , and pyramidal tract signs ( 8 of 9 members [ 88 . 9 % ] ) with an age at onset between the second and sixth decades of life .|Besides cerebellar and pontine atrophy , magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed the hot cross bun sign ( 4 of 6 members [ 66 . 7 % ] ) , pontine midline linear hyperintensity ( 2 of 6 members [ 33 . 3 % ] ) , or high intensity in the middle cerebellar peduncle ( 1 of 6 members [ 16 . 7 % ] ) , which are all reminiscent of multiple system atrophy in tested patients .|Using linkage analysis combined with exome and whole - genome sequencing , we identified a novel heterozygous mutation in the ELOVL fatty acid elongase 4 ( ELOVL4 ) gene ( c . 736T > G , p . W246G ) in both families .|Haplotype analysis indicated that it was unlikely that these 2 Japanese families shared a common ancestor .|Although a missense mutation in ELOVL4 ( c . 504G > C , p . L168F ) was recently reported to be associated with SCA with erythrokeratodermia variabilis ( SCA34 ) in a French - Canadian family , signs of erythrokeratodermia variabilis were absent in our families .|CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE : Combined with the results of the family with SCA34 reported previously , this report confirms that mutations in ELOVL4 can cause dominantly inherited neurodegeneration severely affecting the cerebellum and brainstem .|We should be aware that the presence of multiple system atrophy - like features on magnetic resonance imaging scans , together with cerebellar and brainstem atrophy , suggests SCA34 , even when erythrokeratodermia variabilis is absent .|The present study further broadened the spectrum of the clinical presentations of SCA34 associated with mutations in ELOVL4 , which is involved in the biosynthesis of very long - chain fatty acids .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	379-380	330-333	rs1131692036	c . 736T > G|p .

26222694	Frequency of the p . Gly262Asp mutation in congenital Factor X deficiency .|INTRODUCTION : Congenital factor X ( FX ) deficiency is a rare bleeding disorder inherited as an autosomal recessive trait with an incidence of 1 : 500 000 - 1 000 000 .|A total or partial deficiency of FX causes an impairment of clot formation , leading to a haemorrhagic disease , which manifests with bleeding symptoms of different severity , also unprovoked .|AIM : We analysed the clinical manifestations , laboratory phenotype and genotype in 12 patients from Turkey affected with severe FX deficiency .|METHODS : Prothrombin time ( PT ) , activated partial thromboplastin time ( APTT ) , FX activity ( FX : C ) and FX antigen level ( FX : Ag ) were measured , and mutation analysis was performed for all patients .|RESULTS : The most frequent bleeding episodes in patients were epistaxis and easy bruising ( 11 / 12 , 91 % ) , followed by haemarthroses ( 10 / 12 , 83 % ) .|FX : C was < 1 % in 11 patients , and 4 % in one .|FX : Ag was reduced in all patients , consistent with type II deficiency .|Direct sequencing of the factor X gene ( F10 ) identified two different mutations : the novel 33 bp in - frame deletion p . Thr176_Gln186 , c . 526_558del , which seems to be associated with milder bleeding symptoms and the c . 785G > A , p . Gly262Asp missense mutation ( previously reported as Gly222Asp ) , which is associated with severe bleeding symptoms .|CONCLUSION : The p . Gly262Asp missense mutation was identified in 11 of the 12 patients in this study .|Previously published cases on the same p . Gly262Asp mutation were Iranian patients originating from the border between Turkey and Iran suggesting that this mutation may be candidate as a good tool for mutational screening analysis in this area .	1:VDA:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	3-6	8-12	rs1393705267	p .

26942290	Mosaic Activating Mutations in FGFR1 Cause Encephalocraniocutaneous Lipomatosis .|Encephalocraniocutaneous lipomatosis ( ECCL ) is a sporadic condition characterized by ocular , cutaneous , and central nervous system anomalies .|Key clinical features include a well - demarcated hairless fatty nevus on the scalp , benign ocular tumors , and central nervous system lipomas .|Seizures , spasticity , and intellectual disability can be present , although affected individuals without seizures and with normal intellect have also been reported .|Given the patchy and asymmetric nature of the malformations , ECCL has been hypothesized to be due to a post - zygotic , mosaic mutation .|Despite phenotypic overlap with several other disorders associated with mutations in the RAS - MAPK and PI3K - AKT pathways , the molecular etiology of ECCL remains unknown .|Using exome sequencing of DNA from multiple affected tissues from five unrelated individuals with ECCL , we identified two mosaic mutations , c . 1638C > A ( p . Asn546Lys ) and c . 1966A > G ( p . Lys656Glu ) within the tyrosine kinase domain of FGFR1 , in two affected individuals each .|These two residues are the most commonly mutated residues in FGFR1 in human cancers and are associated primarily with CNS tumors .|Targeted resequencing of FGFR1 in multiple tissues from an independent cohort of individuals with ECCL identified one additional individual with a c . 1638C > A ( p . Asn546Lys ) mutation in FGFR1 .|Functional studies of ECCL fibroblast cell lines show increased levels of phosphorylated FGFRs and phosphorylated FRS2 , a direct substrate of FGFR1 , as well as constitutive activation of RAS - MAPK signaling .|In addition to identifying the molecular etiology of ECCL , our results support the emerging overlap between mosaic developmental disorders and tumorigenesis .	1:VDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	235-240	228-229	rs779707422	c . 1638C > A|p .

27259862	Cardiovascular magnetic resonance of mitral valve length in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy .|BACKGROUND : Previous data suggest that mitral valve leaflets are elongated in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( HCM ) , and mitral valve leaflet elongation may constitute a primary phenotypic expression of HCM .|Our objective was to measure the length of mitral valve leaflets by cardiovascular magnetic resonance ( CMR ) in subjects with HCM caused by a Finnish founder mutation in the myosin - binding protein C gene ( MYBPC3 - Q1061X ) , carriers of the same mutation without left ventricular hypertrophy , as well as in unselected consecutive patients with HCM , and respective controls .|METHODS : Anterior mitral valve leaflet ( AML ) and posterior mitral valve leaflet ( PML ) lengths were measured by CMR in 47 subjects with the Q1061X mutation in the gene encoding MYBPC3 and in 20 healthy relatives without the mutation .|In addition , mitral valve leaflet lengths were measured by CMR in 80 consecutive non - genotyped patients with HCM in CMR and 71 age - and gender - matched healthy subjects .|RESULTS : Of the subjects with the MYBPC - Q1016X mutation , 32 had left ventricular hypertrophy ( LVH , LV maximal wall thickness > = 13 mm in CMR ) and 15 had no hypertrophy .|PML was longer in patients with the MYBPC3 - Q1061X mutation and LVH than in controls of the MYBPC group ( 12 . 8 + - 2 . 8 vs 10 . 6 + - 1 . 9 mm , P = 0 . 013 ) , but the difference between the groups was not statistically significant when PML was indexed for BSA ( P = 0 . 066 ) , or when PML length was adjusted for BSA , age , gender , LV mass and ejection fraction ( P = 0 . 195 ) .|There was no significant difference in the PML length in mutation carriers without LVH and controls ( 11 . 1 + - 3 . 4 vs 10 . 6 + - 1 . 9 , P = 0 . 52 ) .|We found no difference in AML lengths between the MYBPC mutation carriers with or without hypertrophy and controls .|In 80 consecutive non - genotyped patients with HCM , there was no difference either in AML or PML lengths in subjects with HCM compared to respective control subjects .|CONCLUSIONS : In subjects with HCM caused by the Q1061X mutation in the MYBPC3 gene , the posterior mitral valve leaflets may be elongated , but mitral valve elongation does not constitute primary phenotypic expression of the disease .|Instead , elongated mitral valve leaflets seem to be associated with body size and left ventricular remodeling .	1:VDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	419-420	415-416	rs397516005	Q1061X|Q1061X|Q1061X|Q1061X	ProteinMutation	82:136:231:419	83:137:232:420	2:3:6:10	D002312	hypertrophic cardiomyopathy|hypertrophic cardiomyopathy|HCM|HCM|HCM|ventricular hypertrophy|HCM|HCM|HCM|HCM|HCM	Disease	8:23:26:41:64:92:103:171:388:403:415	10:25:27:42:65:94:104:172:389:404:416	0:1:1:1:2:2:2:4:9:9:10	4607	None	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	116-117	136-137	rs397516005	Q1061X|Q1061X|Q1061X|Q1061X	ProteinMutation	82:136:231:419	83:137:232:420	2:3:6:10	D008946	Anterior mitral valve leaflet|AML|AML|AML	Disease	111:116:366:396	115:117:367:397	3:3:8:9	4607	None	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	231-232	234-235	rs397516005	Q1061X|Q1061X|Q1061X|Q1061X	ProteinMutation	82:136:231:419	83:137:232:420	2:3:6:10	D017379	left ventricular hypertrophy|LVH|LVH|LVH	Disease	199:203:234:332	202:204:235:333	5:5:6:7	4607	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	220-221	231-232	rs397516005	Q1061X|Q1061X|Q1061X|Q1061X	ProteinMutation	82:136:231:419	83:137:232:420	2:3:6:10	D006984	hypertrophy|hypertrophy	Disease	220:376	221:377	5:8	4607	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	419-420	464-466	rs397516005	Q1061X|Q1061X|Q1061X|Q1061X	ProteinMutation	82:136:231:419	83:137:232:420	2:3:6:10	D020257	ventricular remodeling	Disease	464	466	11	4607	None

27381756	Further Insights in the Most Common SCN5A Mutation Causing Overlapping Phenotype of Long QT Syndrome , Brugada Syndrome , and Conduction Defect .|BACKGROUND : Phenotypic overlap of type 3 long QT syndrome ( LQT3 ) , Brugada syndrome ( BrS ) , cardiac conduction disease ( CCD ) , and sinus node dysfunction ( SND ) is observed with SCN5A mutations .|SCN5A - E1784K is the most common mutation associated with BrS and LQTS3 .|The present study examines the genotype - phenotype relationship in a large family carrying SCN5A - E1784K and SCN5A - H558R polymorphism .|METHODS AND RESULTS : Clinical work - up , follow - up , and genetic analysis were performed in 35 family members .|Seventeen were SCN5A - E1784K positive .|They also displayed QTc prolongation , and either BrS , CCD , or both .|One carrier exhibited SND .|The presence of SCN5A - H558R did not significantly alter the phenotype of SCN5A - E1784K carriers .|Fourteen SCN5A - E1784K patients underwent implantable cardioverter - defibrillator ( ICD ) implantation ; 4 developed VF and received appropriate ICD shocks after 8 + - 3 months of follow - up .|One patient without ICD also developed VF after 6 . 7 years .|These 5 cases carried both SCN5A - E1784K and SCN5A - H558R .|Functional characterization was achieved by expressing SCN5A variants in TSA201 cells .|Peak ( INa , P ) or late ( INa , L ) sodium currents were recorded using whole - cell patch - clamp techniques .|Co - expression of SCN5A - E1784K and SCN5A - WT reduced INa , P to 70 . 03 % of WT , shifted steady - state inactivation by - 11 . 03 mV , and increased INa , L from 0 . 14 % to 1 . 86 % of INa , P .|Similar changes were observed when SCN5A - E1784K was co - expressed with SCN5A - H558R .|CONCLUSIONS : We demonstrate a strong genotype - phenotype correlation with complete penetrance for BrS , LQTS , or CCD in the largest family harboring SCN5A - E1784K mutation described so far .|Phenotype of LQTS is present during all decades of life , whereas CCD develops with increasing age .|Phenotypic overlap may explain the high event rate in carriers .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	133-135	127-128	rs137854601	E1784K|E1784K|E1784K|E1784K|E1784K|E1784K|E1784K|E1784K|E1784K	ProteinMutation	65:93:127:165:171:222:272:328:365	66:94:128:166:172:223:273:329:366	2:3:5:8:9:11:14:15:16	D008133	Long QT Syndrome|long QT syndrome ( LQT3 ) , Brugada syndrome|QTc prolongation	Disease	12:30:133	15:39:135	0:1:6	6331	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	155-156	133-135	rs1805124	H558R|H558R|H558R|H558R	ProteinMutation	97:155:226:336	98:156:227:337	3:8:11:15	D008133	Long QT Syndrome|long QT syndrome ( LQT3 ) , Brugada syndrome|QTc prolongation	Disease	12:30:133	15:39:135	0:1:6	6331	None	1:VDA:2	R2L	CROSS	65-66	16-18	rs137854601	E1784K|E1784K|E1784K|E1784K|E1784K|E1784K|E1784K|E1784K|E1784K	ProteinMutation	65:93:127:165:171:222:272:328:365	66:94:128:166:172:223:273:329:366	2:3:5:8:9:11:14:15:16	D053840	Brugada Syndrome	Disease	16	18	0	6331	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	97-98	16-18	rs1805124	H558R|H558R|H558R|H558R	ProteinMutation	97:155:226:336	98:156:227:337	3:8:11:15	D053840	Brugada Syndrome	Disease	16	18	0	6331	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	365-366	357-358	rs137854601	E1784K|E1784K|E1784K|E1784K|E1784K|E1784K|E1784K|E1784K|E1784K	ProteinMutation	65:93:127:165:171:222:272:328:365	66:94:128:166:172:223:273:329:366	2:3:5:8:9:11:14:15:16	D006331	cardiac conduction disease|CCD|CCD|CCD|CCD	Disease	43:47:140:357:383	46:48:141:358:384	1:1:6:16:17	6331	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	155-156	140-141	rs1805124	H558R|H558R|H558R|H558R	ProteinMutation	97:155:226:336	98:156:227:337	3:8:11:15	D006331	cardiac conduction disease|CCD|CCD|CCD|CCD	Disease	43:47:140:357:383	46:48:141:358:384	1:1:6:16:17	6331	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	65-66	55-56	rs137854601	E1784K|E1784K|E1784K|E1784K|E1784K|E1784K|E1784K|E1784K|E1784K	ProteinMutation	65:93:127:165:171:222:272:328:365	66:94:128:166:172:223:273:329:366	2:3:5:8:9:11:14:15:16	D012804	sinus node dysfunction|SND|SND	Disease	51:55:148	54:56:149	1:1:7	6331	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	155-156	148-149	rs1805124	H558R|H558R|H558R|H558R	ProteinMutation	97:155:226:336	98:156:227:337	3:8:11:15	D012804	sinus node dysfunction|SND|SND	Disease	51:55:148	54:56:149	1:1:7	6331	None	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	171-172	185-186	rs137854601	E1784K|E1784K|E1784K|E1784K|E1784K|E1784K|E1784K|E1784K|E1784K	ProteinMutation	65:93:127:165:171:222:272:328:365	66:94:128:166:172:223:273:329:366	2:3:5:8:9:11:14:15:16	D014693	VF|VF	Disease	185:208	186:209	9:10	6331	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	208-209	226-227	rs1805124	H558R|H558R|H558R|H558R	ProteinMutation	97:155:226:336	98:156:227:337	3:8:11:15	D014693	VF|VF	Disease	185:208	186:209	9:10	6331	None
27388325	Efficacy of sorafenib in BRAF - mutated non - small - cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) and no response in synchronous BRAF wild type - hepatocellular carcinoma : a case report .|BACKGROUND : Sorafenib is a multi - targeted kinase inhibitor with a demonstrated activity in renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) and hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , and it is currently used for the treatment of these pathologies .|Ongoing clinical trials are studying its activity in other malignancies , such as non - small - cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) .|However , no biological marker is known to define either the sensitivity or resistance to the drug .|CASE PRESENTATION : Here we report a case of a patient with two synchronous tumors , HCC and NSCLC , with metastases in the contralateral lung and bone .|The patient was treated with gemcitabine as first line , with a resulting progressive disease after two months , and then with sorafenib at standard dosage in the second line setting .|After 6 months of treatment CT scan showed a partial response in the primary lesion of the lung , complete response of the metastasis in the contralateral lung , and stability of HCC .|The patient had progression in the lung , liver and bone after 13 months of therapy .|A molecular characterization of NSCLC and HCC lesions was performed , revealing a BRAF exon 11 mutation ( G469V ) only in NSCLC .|We hypothesize that the response observed in NSCLC lesions could be due to the presence of BRAF mutation , and that this alteration could be responsible in determining sorafenib sensitivity .|CONCLUSIONS : Results observed in this case encourage further research on the activity of sorafenib in both HCC and NSCLC , based on the presence of BRAF mutation .|This could lead to a selection of HCC patients to be treated with this drug , and could help identify a novel treatment strategy for BRAF - mutated NSCLC patients .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	245-246	12-14	rs121913355	G469V	ProteinMutation	245	246	8	D008175	lung cancer	Disease	12	14	0	673	None	1:VDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	249-250	245-246	rs121913355	G469V	ProteinMutation	245	246	8	D002289	NSCLC|non - small - cell lung cancer|NSCLC|NSCLC|NSCLC|NSCLC|NSCLC|NSCLC|NSCLC	Disease	15:86:94:133:231:249:258:301:339	16:93:95:134:232:250:259:302:340	0:2:2:4:8:8:9:10:11	673	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	245-246	233-234	rs121913355	G469V	ProteinMutation	245	246	8	D006528	synchronous BRAF wild type - hepatocellular carcinoma|hepatocellular carcinoma|HCC|HCC|HCC|HCC|HCC|HCC	Disease	21:55:58:131:208:233:299:318	28:57:59:132:209:234:300:319	0:1:1:4:6:8:10:11	673	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	245-246	52-53	rs121913355	G469V	ProteinMutation	245	246	8	C538614	renal cell carcinoma|RCC	Disease	48:52	51:53	1:1	673	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	245-246	82-83	rs121913355	G469V	ProteinMutation	245	246	8	D009369	malignancies	Disease	82	83	2	673	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	245-246	128-130	rs121913355	G469V	ProteinMutation	245	246	8	D009378	synchronous tumors	Disease	128	130	4	673	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	245-246	136-137	rs121913355	G469V	ProteinMutation	245	246	8	D009362	metastases	Disease	136	137	4	673	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	245-246	157-159	rs121913355	G469V	ProteinMutation	245	246	8	D018450	progressive disease	Disease	157	159	5	673	None

27769063	Risk of eighteen genome - wide association study - identified genetic variants for colorectal cancer and colorectal adenoma in Han Chinese .|BACKGROUND : Recent genome - wide association studies ( GWAS ) identified eighteen single - nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) to be significantly associated with the risk of colorectal cancer ( CRC ) .|However , overall results of the following replications are inconsistent and little is known about whether these associations also exit in colorectal adenomas ( CRA ) .|METHODS : The SNP genotyping was performed using a Sequenom MassARRAY to investigate the association of these eighteen SNPs with colorectal neoplasm in a case - control study consisted of 1049 colorectal cancers , 283 adenomas , and 1030 controls .|RESULTS : Two of these SNPs , rs10505477 and rs719725 , showed evidence of an association in both CRC and CRA in our study population .|Besides , seven SNPs ( rs10808555 , rs7014346 , rs7837328 , rs704017 , rs11196172 , rs4779584 , and rs7229639 ) were significantly associated with CRC , and another one SNP rs11903757 was over - represented in CRA compared with controls .|The strongest association was provided by

previously reported SNP associations also have impact on CRC and CRA predispositions in the Han Chinese population .|A part of genetic risk to CRC is possibly mediated by susceptibility to adenomas

28056872	A limb - girdle myopathy phenotype of RUNX2 mutation in a patient with cleidocranial dysplasia : a case study and literature review .|BACKGROUND : Cleidocranial dysplasia ( CCD ) is a rare hereditary disorder that arises from heterozygous loss of function mutations in the runt - related transcription factor 2 ( RUNX2 ) gene .|As RUNX2 is mainly expressed in osteoblasts , CCD typically affects the skeletal and dental systems .|Few studies have investigated RUNX2 mutation effects on non - skeletal systems .|Here , we describe limb - girdle myopathy , an uncommon phenotype of CCD , in a patient with a heterozygous missense mutation ( p . R225Q ) in the RUNX2 gene .|CASE PRESENTATION : A 58 year - old man presented with progressive back pain and six months of weakness in the proximal parts of all four limbs .|Physical examinations showed that he was short in stature ( height , 164 . 4 cm ; weight , 79 . 1 kg ) with a dysmorphic face , including hypertelorism , midface hypoplasia , and chin protrusion .|At a young age , he had received orthodontic surgery , due to dental abnormalities .|Neurological examinations revealed sloping shoulders , weakness , and atrophy in the proximal areas of the arms , shoulder girdle muscles , and legs .|The deep tendon reflex and sensory system were normal .|Radiological examinations revealed mild scoliosis , shortened clavicles , and a depressed skull bone , which were consistent with a clinical diagnosis of CCD .|Electromyography ( EMG ) studies showed myogenic polyphasic waves in the deltoid , biceps brachii , and rectus femoris muscles .|Instead , the EMG findings were normal in the first dorsal interosseous , tibialis anterior and facial muscles .|The EMG findings were compatible with a limb - girdle pattern with facial sparing .|The patient 's family history showed his father and eldest daughter with similar dysmorphic faces , skeletal disorders and proximal upper extremity weakness .|We sequenced the RUNX2 gene and discovered a heterozygous missense mutation ( c . G674A , p . R225Q ) , which altered the C - terminal end of the RUNX2 protein .|This mutation was predicted to inactivate the protein and might affect its interactions with other proteins .|This mutation co - segregated with the disease phenotypes in the family .|CONCLUSIONS : We described limb - girdle myopathy in a patient with CCD that carried a heterozygous RUNX2 missense mutation .|This uncommon phenotype expanded the phenotypic spectrum of the RUNX2 p . R225Q mutation .|The role of RUNX2 in myogenic development merits future studies .|Our findings remind clinicians that myopathic patients with myopathies combined with facial dysmorphism and shortened clavicles should consider the diagnosis of CCD .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	110-113	90-94	rs104893991	p .

28115489	Functional Validation of a Common Nonsynonymous Coding Variant in ZC3HC1 Associated With Protection From Coronary Artery Disease .|BACKGROUND : Although virtually all coronary artery disease associated single - nucleotide polymorphisms identified by genome - wide association studies ( GWAS ) are in noncoding regions of the genome , a common polymorphism in ZC3HC1 ( rs11556924 ) , resulting in an arginine ( Arg ) to histidine ( His ) substitution in its encoded protein , NIPA ( Nuclear Interacting Partner of Anaplastic Lyphoma Kinase ) is linked to a protection from coronary artery disease .|NIPA plays a role in cell cycle progression , but the functional consequences of this polymorphism have not been established .|METHODS AND RESULTS : Here we demonstrate that total ZC3HC1 expression in whole blood is similar across genotypes , despite expression being slightly biased toward the risk allele in heterozygotes .|At the protein level , the protective His363 NIPA variant exhibits increased phosphorylation of a critical serine residue ( Ser354 ) and higher protein expression as compared with the Arg363 variant .|Binding experiments indicate that neither SKP1 ( S - phase kinase - associated protein 1 ) nor CCNB1 binding were affected by the polymorphism .|Despite similar nuclear distribution , NIPA His363 exhibits greater nuclear mobility .|NIPA suppression results in a modest reduction of proliferation in vascular smooth muscle cells , but given low proliferative capacity , a significant effect of the variant was not noted .|By contrast , we demonstrate that the protective variant reduces cell proliferation in HeLa cells .|CONCLUSIONS : These findings extend the genetic association between rs11556924 and coronary artery disease risk by characterizing its effects on the encoded protein , NIPA .|The resulting amino acid change Arg363His is associated with increased expression and nuclear mobility , as well as lower rates of cell growth in HeLa cells , further supporting a role for cell proliferation in atherosclerosis and its clinical consequences .	1:VDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	275-278	273-274	rs11556924	rs11556924|rs11556924	SNP	55:273	56:274	1:9	D003324	Coronary Artery Disease|coronary artery disease|coronary artery disease|coronary artery disease	Disease	14:23:92:275	17:26:95:278	0:1:1:9	51530	None	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	55-56	82-84	rs11556924	rs11556924|rs11556924	SNP	55:273	56:274	1:9	D002277	Anaplastic Lyphoma	Disease	82	84	1	51530	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	273-274	325-326	rs11556924	rs11556924|rs11556924	SNP	55:273	56:274	1:9	D050197	atherosclerosis	Disease	325	326	10	51530	None

Summary answer : GWAS analysis uncovered multiple pathways that are statistically enriched for genetic association signals , analysis of Stage A disease highlighted a novel variant in MAP3K4 , while top pathways significantly associated with all endometriosis and Stage A disease included several mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) - related pathways .|What is known already : Endometriosis is a complex disease with an estimated heritability of 50 % .|To date , GWAS revealed 10 genomic regions associated with endometriosis , explaining < 4 % of heritability , while half of the heritability is estimated to be due to common risk variants .|Pathway analyses combine the evidence of single variants into gene - based measures , leveraging the aggregate effect of variants in genes and uncovering biological pathways involved in disease pathogenesis .|Study design size , duration : Pathway analysis was conducted utilizing the International Endogene Consortium GWAS data , comprising 3194 surgically confirmed endometriosis cases and 7060 controls of European ancestry with genotype data imputed up to 1000 Genomes Phase three reference panel .|GWAS was performed for all endometriosis cases and for Stage A ( revised American Fertility Society ( rAFS ) I / II , n = 1686 ) and B ( rAFS III / IV , n = 1364 ) cases separately .|The identified significant pathways were compared with pathways previously investigated in the literature through candidate association studies .|Participants / materials , setting , methods : The most comprehensive biological pathway databases , MSigDB ( including BioCarta , KEGG , PID , SA , SIG , ST and GO ) and PANTHER were utilized to test for enrichment of genetic variants associated with endometriosis .|Statistical enrichment analysis was performed using the MAGENTA ( Meta - Analysis Gene - set Enrichment of variaNT Associations ) software .|Main results and the role of chance : The first genome - wide association analysis for Stage A endometriosis revealed a novel locus , rs144240142 ( P = 6 . 45 x 10 - 8 , OR = 1 . 71 , 95 % CI = 1 . 23 - 2 . 37 ) , an intronic single - nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) within MAP3K4 .|This SNP was not associated with Stage B disease ( P = 0 . 086 ) .|MAP3K4 was also shown to be differentially expressed in eutopic endometrium between Stage A endometriosis cases and controls ( P = 3 . 8 x 10 - 4 ) , but not with Stage B disease ( P = 0 . 26 ) .|A total of 14 pathways enriched with genetic endometriosis associations were identified ( false discovery rate ( FDR ) - P < 0 . 05 ) .|The pathways associated with any endometriosis were Grb2 - Sos provides linkage to MAPK signaling for integrins pathway ( P = 2 . 8 x 10 - 5 , FDR - P = 3 . 0 x 10 - 3 ) , Wnt signaling ( P = 0 . 026 , FDR - P = 0 . 026 ) and p130Cas linkage to MAPK signaling for integrins pathway ( P = 6 . 0 x 10 - 4 , FDR - P = 0 . 029 ) ; with Stage A endometriosis : extracellular signal - regulated kinase ( ERK ) 1 ERK2 MAPK ( P = 5 . 0 x 10 - 4 , FDR - P = 5 . 0 x 10 - 4 ) and with Stage B endometriosis : two overlapping pathways that related to extracellular matrix biology - Core matrisome ( P = 1 . 4 x 10 - 3 , FDR - P = 0 . 013 ) and ECM glycoproteins ( P = 1 . 8 x 10 - 3 , FDR - P = 7 . 1 x 10 - 3 ) .|Genes arising from endometriosis candidate gene studies performed to date were enriched for Interleukin signaling pathway ( P = 2 . 3 x 10 - 12 ) , Apoptosis signaling pathway ( P = 9 . 7 x 10 - 9 ) and Gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor pathway ( P = 1 . 2 x 10 - 6 ) ; however , these pathways did not feature in the results based on GWAS data .|Large scale data : Not applicable .|Limitations , reasons for caution : The analysis is restricted to ( i ) variants in / near genes that can be assigned to pathways , excluding intergenic variants ; ( ii ) the gene - based pathway definition as registered in the databases ; ( iii ) women of European ancestry .|Wider implications of the findings : The top ranked pathways associated with overall and Stage A endometriosis in particular involve integrin - mediated MAPK activation and intracellular ERK / MAPK acting downstream in the MAPK cascade , both acting in the control of cell division , gene expression , cell movement and survival .|Other top enriched pathways in Stage B disease include ECM glycoprotein pathways important for extracellular structure and biochemical support .|The results highlight the need for increased efforts to understand the functional role of these pathways in endometriosis pathogenesis , including the investigation of the biological effects of the genetic variants on downstream molecular processes in tissue relevant to endometriosis .|Additionally , our results offer further support for the hypothesis of at least partially distinct causal pathophysiology for minimal / mild ( rAFS I / II ) vs .|moderate / severe ( rAFS III / IV ) endometriosis .|Study funding / competing interest ( s ) : The genome - wide association data and Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium ( WTCCC ) were generated through funding from the Wellcome Trust ( WT084766 / Z / 08 / Z , 076113 and 085475 ) and the National Health and Medical Research Council ( NHMRC ) of Australia ( 241944 , 339462 , 389927 , 389875 , 389891 , 389892 , 389938 , 443036 , 442915 , 442981 , 496610 , 496739 , 552485 and 552498 ) .|N .

30098192	Genome - Wide Association Study Identifies a Susceptibility Locus for Comitant Esotropia and Suggests a Parent - of - Origin Effect .|Purpose : To identify genetic variants conferring susceptibility to esotropia .|Esotropia is the most common form of comitant strabismus , has its highest incidence in European ancestry populations , and is believed to be inherited as a complex trait .|Methods : White European American discovery cohorts with nonaccommodative ( 826 cases and 2991 controls ) or accommodative ( 224 cases and 749 controls ) esotropia were investigated .|White European Australian and United Kingdom cohorts with nonaccommodative ( 689 cases and 1448 controls ) or accommodative ( 66 cases and 264 controls ) esotropia were tested for replication .|We performed a genome - wide case - control association study using a mixed linear additive model .|Meta - analyses of discovery and replication cohorts were then conducted .|Results : A significant association with nonaccommodative esotropia was discovered ( odds ratio [ OR ] = 1 . 41 , P = 2 . 84 x 10 - 09 ) and replicated ( OR = 1 . 23 , P = 0 . 01 ) at rs2244352 [ T ] located within intron 1 of the WRB ( tryptophan rich basic protein ) gene on chromosome 21 ( meta - analysis OR = 1 . 33 , P = 9 . 58 x 10 - 11 ) .|This single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) is differentially methylated , and there is a statistically significant skew toward paternal inheritance in the discovery cohort .|Meta - analysis of the accommodative discovery and replication cohorts identified an association with rs912759 [ T ] ( OR = 0 . 59 , P = 1 . 89 x 10 - 08 ) , an intergenic SNP on chromosome 1p31 . 1 .|Conclusions : This is the first genome - wide association study ( GWAS ) to identify significant associations in esotropia and suggests a parent - of - origin effect .|Additional cohorts will permit replication and extension of these findings .|Future studies of rs2244352 and WRB should provide insight into pathophysiological mechanisms underlying comitant strabismus .	1:VDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	357-358	332-333	rs2244352	rs2244352|rs2244352	SNP	200:357	201:358	7:12	D004948	Comitant Esotropia|esotropia|esotropia|esotropia|esotropia|esotropia	Disease	10:31:88:117:160:332	12:32:89:118:161:333	0:1:3:4:7:10	7485	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	332-333	282-283	rs912759	rs912759	SNP	282	283	9	D004948	Comitant Esotropia|esotropia|esotropia|esotropia|esotropia|esotropia	Disease	10:31:88:117:160:332	12:32:89:118:161:333	0:1:3:4:7:10	None	None
30120764	The Association of MYNN and TERC Gene Polymorphisms and Bladder Cancer in a Turkish Population .|PURPOSE : Researchers reported that , MYNN rs10936599 polymorphism is in strong or moderate linkage disequilibrium with SNPs within the 3q26 . 2 chromosomal regions that also include the TERC gene .|In addition , it has been reported that MYNN rs10936599 had a strong cumulative association with bladder cancer risk , and TERC gene suppresses cell growth in bladder cancer cell lines .|Therefore , we aimed to determine whether polymorphisms of MYNN rs10936599 and TERC rs2293607 play any roles for bladder cancer in the Turkish population in this study .|MATERIALS AND METHODS : In this case - control study , 70 patients and 150 controls were investigated .|Genotyping analysis was performed by polymerase chain reaction , restriction fragment length polymorphism and DNA sequencing techniques .|RESULTS : Genotype distribution between study groups for MYNN rs10936599 SNP was significantly different ( P = . 001 ) ; although there was no difference in genotype distribution for TERC rs2293607 SNP .|In addition , patients with CT genotype and CT + TT genotype combination of MYNN SNP have a decreased risk for bladder cancer .|Two times increased risk ratio on development of bladder cancer was obtained for CC genotype of the SNP ( P = . 001 ) .|Besides , it was found that genotype combination of GG + AG / CC versus AA / CC genotypes ( TERC / MYNN ) showed stronger correlation .|We observed that statistically significant relationship between the C - G haplotypes of two polymorphisms and bladder cancer risk ( P = . 0001 ) .|CONCLUSION : At the end of the study , we suggested that there may exist an association between a combination of MYNN rs10936599 and TERC rs2293607 polymorphisms and development of bladder cancer in Turkish population .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	23-24	10-11	rs10936599	rs10936599|rs10936599|rs10936599|rs10936599|rs10936599	SNP	23:57:90:154:304	24:58:91:155:305	1:2:3:6:11	D009369	Cancer	Disease	10	11	0	55892	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	93-94	10-11	rs2293607	rs2293607|rs2293607|rs2293607	SNP	93:176:307	94:177:308	3:6:11	D009369	Cancer	Disease	10	11	0	7012	None	1:VDA:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	57-58	64-66	rs10936599	rs10936599|rs10936599|rs10936599|rs10936599|rs10936599	SNP	23:57:90:154:304	24:58:91:155:305	1:2:3:6:11	D001749	bladder cancer|bladder cancer|bladder cancer|bladder cancer|bladder cancer|bladder cancer|bladder cancer	Disease	64:75:98:200:211:272:312	66:77:100:202:213:274:314	2:2:3:7:8:10:11	55892	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	312-314	307-308	rs2293607	rs2293607|rs2293607|rs2293607	SNP	93:176:307	94:177:308	3:6:11	D001749	bladder cancer|bladder cancer|bladder cancer|bladder cancer|bladder cancer|bladder cancer|bladder cancer	Disease	64:75:98:200:211:272:312	66:77:100:202:213:274:314	2:2:3:7:8:10:11	7012	None
30144538	The relationship between four GWAS - identified loci in Alzheimer 's disease and the risk of Parkinson 's disease , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , and multiple system atrophy .|BACKGROUND : A number of genetic variants have previously been identified and associated with the risk of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) , including rs10838725 in CELF1 , rs28834970 in PTK2B , rs17125944 in FERMT2 , and rs10410544 in SIRT2 based on genome - wide association studies .|Considering the overlap between the clinical manifestation and pathological characteristics of AD and Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) and multiple system atrophy ( MSA ) , we conducted a large sample study to investigate the associations between these variants and these three common neurodegenerative diseases in a Chinese population .|METHODS : A total of 2449 patients , including 1219 PD , 870 sporadic ALS , and 360 MSA , and 821 healthy controls were examined for this study .|All cases were genotyped for single - nucleotide polymorphisms using Sequenom iPLEX assay technology .|RESULTS : No significant differences were found in genotype distribution and minor allele frequencies between the four candidate variants and the three neurodegenerative diseases .|However , a significant difference was found in the minor allele frequency of rs28834970 in PTK2B between PD patients with normal and abnormal cognitive function ( p = 0 . 001 ) .|Moreover , the minor allele " C " was associated with an increased risk for cognitive impairment in PD ( OR = 1 . 84 ) .|Although this observation was not significant ( p = 0 . 064 ) , the mean Addenbrooke 's Cognitive Examination - Revised ( ACER ) score of PD patients with the risk allele of rs28834970 was 2 . 913 + - 1 . 569 points lower than that of PD patients without the risk allele .|CONCLUSION : This study provides new insight into some of the phenotypes that may share the common pathogenesis of different neurodegenerative diseases .	1:VDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	54-55	50-51	rs10838725	rs10838725	SNP	54	55	1	D000544	Alzheimer 's disease|Alzheimer 's

30541462	Pathogenic gene screening in 91 Chinese patients with short stature of unknown etiology with a targeted next - generation sequencing panel .|BACKGROUND : Dwarfism is a common severe growth disorder , but the etiology is unclear in the majority of cases .|Recombinant human growth hormone may be a treatment option , but it has limited efficacy .|The currently known laboratory assays do not meet the precision requirements for clinical diagnosis .|Here , we have constructed a targeted next - generation sequencing ( NGS ) panel of selected genes that are suspected to be associated with dwarfism for genetic screening .|METHODS : Genetic screening of 91 children with short stature of unknown etiology was performed with the help of the NGS panel .|All the coding regions and exon - intron boundaries of 166 genes were included in the panel .|To clarify the pathogenicity of these mutations , their clinical data were reviewed and analyzed .|RESULTS : The assay identified p . A72G , p . I282V , and p . P491S variants of the PTPN11 gene and a p . I437T variant of the SOS1 gene in 4 cases with Noonan syndrome .|A frameshift mutation ( p . D2407fs ) of the ACAN gene was identified in a case of idiopathic short stature with moderately advanced bone age .|A p . R904C variant of the COL2A1 gene was found in a patient , who was accordingly diagnosed with Stickler syndrome .|Severe short stature without limb deformity was associated with a p . G11A variant of HOXD13 .|In addition , we evaluated evidence that a p . D401N variant of the COMP gene may cause multiple epiphyseal dysplasia .|CONCLUSIONS : Our findings suggest that syndromes , particularly Noonan syndrome , may be overlooked due to atypical clinical features .|This gene panel has been verified to be effective for the rapid screening of genetic etiologies associated with short stature and for guiding precision medicine - based clinical management .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	218-221	166-169	rs121918454	p .

30572543	Nonsmall cell lung cancer with rare exon 7 p . A289V mutation in the EGFR gene responds to Icotinib treatment : A case report .|RATIONALE : Mutation p . A289V involving extracellular region of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) exon 7 has not yet been reported in nonsmall cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) .|Studies have shown p . A289V mutation responding to tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) in glioblastoma cell lines suggesting the point mutation as a potential therapeutic target .|However , sufficient evidence of the effect of TKI treatment on the p . A289V mutation involved in NSCLC is not available .|PATIENT CONCERNS : An 80 - year - old nonsmoker male with lung mass was suffering from severe bone pain .|DIAGNOSIS : Needle biopsy and positron emitted tomography / computed tomography were performed .|The patient was diagnosed with advanced NSCLC adenocarcinoma with bone and lymphatic metastasis .|Next - generation sequencing of circulating tumor DNA was performed , which identified a p . A289V mutation in the EGFR gene of the patient .|INTERVENTIONS : Our patient refused to receive chemotherapy and tried Icotinib treatment .|OUTCOMES : Our patient had a partial response to Icotinib after treatment for 5 months during the therapeutic trial by TKIs .|The patient showed adverse symptoms of mild diarrhea and rash ( Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 1 ) during the treatment .|LESSONS : In this case , Icotinib prevented completion of the signal transduction cascade of p . A289V mutant in NSCLC .|Our finding may expand the EGFR mutation spectrum for TKI treatment in NSCLC .|However , the finding needs to be confirmed at a larger scale with NSCLC in Chinese and other populations .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	264-265	259-262	rs149840192	p .

30641209	Associations of the NRF2 / KEAP1 pathway and antioxidant defense gene polymorphisms with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE : Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) is a complex chronic inflammatory disease of the respiratory system affecting primarily distal respiratory pathways and lung parenchyma .|This work was designed as a case - control study aimed at investigating the association of the NRF2 / KEAP1 signaling system , and antioxidant defense gene polymorphisms with COPD in population from Russia .|METHODS : Ten SNPs : NFE2L2 ( rs35652124 ) , KEAP1 ( rs1048290 ) , MPO ( rs2333227 ) , PRNP ( rs1799990 ) , PTGR1 ( rs2273788 ) , HSPA1A ( rs1008438 ) , TXNRD2 ( rs1139793 ) , GSR ( rs1002149 ) , SIRT2 ( rs10410544 ) , and PTGS1 ( rs1330344 ) were genotyped by the real - time polymerase chain reaction ( TaqMan assays ) in a case - control study ( 425 COPD patients and 457 controls , from the same region of Russia , representatives of Tatar population ) .|Logistic regression was used to detect the association of SNPs in different models .|Linear regression analyses were performed to estimate the relationship between SNPs and lung function parameters and smoking pack - years .|THE RESULTS : In our population , a significant associations of KEAP1 ( rs1048290 ) ( P = 0 . 0015 , OR = 0 . 72 in additive model ) , HSPA1A ( rs1008438 ) ( P = 0 . 006 , OR = 2 . 26 in recessive model ) , GSR ( rs1002149 ) ( P = 0 . 037 , OR = 1 . 31 in additive model ) with COPD were revealed .|NFE2L2 ( rs35652124 ) , PRNP ( rs1799990 ) , and HSPA1A ( rs1008438 ) were significantly associated with COPD only in smokers .|In nonsmokers , significant association was established for GSR ( rs1002149 ) .|KEAP1 ( rs1048290 ) was associated with COPD in both groups .|The relationship between KEAP1 ( rs1048290 ) , NFE2L2 ( rs35652124 ) , and HSPA1A ( rs1008438 ) and smoking pack - years was found ( P = 0 . 005 , P = 0 . 0028 , P = 0 . 015 ) .|A significant genotype - dependent variation of forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in 1 s was observed for SIRT2 ( rs10410544 ) ( P = 0 . 04 ) , NFE2L2 ( rs35652124 ) ( P = 0 . 028 ) , and PRNP ( rs1799990 ) ( P = 0 . 044 )

30946460	A synonymous VHL variant in exon 2 confers susceptibility to familial pheochromocytoma and von Hippel - Lindau disease .|CONTEXT : von Hippel - Lindau disease , comprising renal cancer , hemangioblastoma and / or pheochromocytoma ( PHEO ) is caused by missense or truncating variants of the VHL tumor suppressor gene , which is involved in degradation of hypoxia inducible factors ( HIFs ) .|However , the role of synonymous VHL variants in the disease is unclear .|OBJECTIVE : We evaluated a synonymous VHL variant in patients with familial PHEO or VHL disease without a detectable pathogenic VHL mutation .|DESIGN : We performed genetic and transcriptional analyses of leukocytes and / or tumors from affected and unaffected individuals and evaluated VHL splicing in existing cancer databases .|RESULTS : We identified a synonymous VHL variant ( c . 414A > G , p . Pro138Pro ) as the driver event in five independent individuals / families with PHEOs or VHL syndrome .|This variant promotes exon 2 skipping and , hence , abolishes expression of the full - length VHL transcript .|Exon 2 spans the HIF binding domain , required for HIF degradation by VHL .|Accordingly , PHEOs carrying this variant display HIF hyperactivation typical of VHL loss .|Moreover , other exon 2 VHL variants from the TCGA pan - cancer datasets are biased toward expression of a VHL transcript that excludes this exon , supporting a broader impact of this spliced variant .|CONCLUSION : A recurrent synonymous VHL variant ( c . 414A > G , p . Pro138Pro ) confers susceptibility to PHEO and VHL disease through splice disruption , leading to VHL dysfunction .|This finding indicates that certain synonymous VHL variants may be clinically relevant and should be considered in genetic testing and surveillance settings .|The observation that other coding VHL variants can exclude exon 2 suggests that dysregulated splicing may be an underappreciated mechanism in VHL - mediated tumorigenesis .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	140-145	10-12	rs869025648	c . 414A > G|p .

30968502	The nonsense mutation MSH2 c . 2152C > T shows a founder effect in Portuguese Lynch syndrome families .|The mutational spectrum of the MMR genes is highly heterogeneous , but specific mutations are observed at high frequencies in well - defined populations or ethnic groups , due to founder effects .|The MSH2 mutation c . 2152C > T , p . ( Gln718 * ) , has occasionally been described in Lynch families worldwide , including in Portuguese Lynch syndrome families .|During genetic testing for Lynch syndrome at the Portuguese Oncology Institutes of Porto and Lisbon , this mutation was identified in 28 seemingly unrelated families .|In order to evaluate if this alteration is a founder mutation , haplotype analysis using microsatellite and SNP markers flanking the MSH2 gene was performed in the 28 probands and 87 family members .|Additionally , the geographic origin of these families was evaluated and the age of the mutation estimated .|Twelve different haplotypes were phased for 13 out of the 28 families and shared a conserved region of ~3 . 6 Mb .|Based on the mutation and recombination events observed in the microsatellite haplotypes and assuming a generation time of 25 years , the age estimate for the MSH2 mutation was 273 + - 64 years .|The geographic origins of these families were mostly from the Northern region of Portugal .|Concluding , these results suggest that the MSH2 c . 2152C > T alteration is a founder mutation in Portugal with a relatively recent origin .|Furthermore , its high proportion indicates that screening for this mutation as a first step , together with the previously reported Portuguese founder mutations , may be cost - effective in genetic testing of Lynch syndrome suspects of Portuguese ancestry .	1:VDA:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	4-9	15-17	rs587779139	c . 2152C > T|c . 2152C > T|c . 2152C > T	DNAMutation	4:55:243	9:60:248	0:2:9	D003123	Lynch syndrome|Lynch syndrome|Lynch syndrome|Lynch syndrome	Disease	15:80:88:295	17:82:90:297	0:2:3:10	4436	None

31089398	A Common Variant of ASAP1 Is Associated with Tuberculosis Susceptibility in the Han Chinese Population .|Background : ASAP1 ( also known as AMAP1 or DDEF1 ) encodes an Arf GTPase - activating protein ( Arf GAP ) , a multifunctional scaffold protein that induces hydrolysis of GTP bound to the ADP - ribosylation factor ( Arf ) family GTP - binding proteins .|Reduction of ASAP1 expression in vitro was related to suppression of cell migration and invasiveness .|The genetic variant rs4733781 of the ASAP1 gene was revealed as a significant locus for tuberculosis ( TB ) susceptibility , but the results still need to be validated .|Methods : Blood samples from a total of 1914 active TB and healthy controls ( HC ) were collected to evaluate rs4733781 and the risk of TB .|Meanwhile , a total of 48 noninfected HC , latent TB - infected ( LTBI ) controls , and active TB were collected to assay ASAP1 expression difference among the three groups .|The QuantiFERON - TB Gold In - Tube was adopted to identify noninfected HC and LTBI .|Results : The genetic variant of rs4733781 was found to be significantly associated with TB , and the A allele of rs4733781 ( C > A ) was 0 . 38 and 0 . 43 among TB cases and HC , respectively ( P = 0 . 0035 ) .|Meanwhile , the peripheral blood monocyte RNA fold changes for the ASAP1 gene among the 16 HC , 16 LTBI , and 16 active TB were 1 . 088 + - 0 . 4919 , 2 . 237 + - 0 . 6505 , and 10 . 12 + - 10 . 98 ( F = 9 . 559 , P = 0 . 0003 ) , respectively , and the expression of ASAP1 was increased by 2 . 06 - fold ( P < 0 . 0001 ) and 9 . 30 - fold ( P < 0 . 0052 ) for LTBI and active TB , when compared to the HC .|Conclusions : Our data indicated that the A allele of rs4733781 for the ASAP1 gene was in association with a decreased risk of TB .|But not only that , the overexpression of the ASAP1 gene among LTBI and TB was related to the progression of TB , which further implies that the expression of ASAP1 would be a potential biomarker for LTBI and TB diagnoses .	1:VDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	136-137	131-132	rs4733781	rs4733781|rs4733781|rs4733781|rs4733781|rs4733781	SNP	83:131:194:209:362	84:132:195:210:363	3:4:7:7:9	D014376	Tuberculosis|tuberculosis|TB|TB|TB|TB|TB|TB|TB|TB|TB|TB|TB|TB|TB|TB	Disease	8:95:97:120:136:148:158:174:202:224:262:344:375:391:398:416	9:96:98:121:137:149:159:175:203:225:263:345:376:392:399:417	0:3:3:4:4:5:5:6:7:7:8:8:9:10:10:10	50807	None

R518C variant associated with prolonged QT intervals , cardiomyopathy , and sudden cardiac death in several pedigrees .|METHODS : To characterize a patient - derived human induced pluripotent stem cell - derived cardiomyocyte ( hiPSC - CM ) CACNA1C - p . R518C model , CACNA1C - p . R518C hiPSC - CMs were generated from a 13 - year - old man ( QTc , > 480 ms ) with a family history of sudden cardiac death .|An isogenic hiPSC - CM gene - corrected control was created using CRISPR / Cas9 ( clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats / clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat - associated 9 ) .|APD and calcium handling were assessed by live cell imaging with Arclight voltage and Fluo - 4 calcium indicators , respectively .|The APD and L - type calcium channel biophysical properties were further assessed by whole - cell patch clamp technique .|RESULTS : The Bazett formula - corrected , Arclight - measured APD90 of CACNA1C - p . R518C hiPSC - CMs was significantly longer ( 622 + - 11 ms ; n = 92 ) than the isogenic control hiPSC - CMs ( 453 + - 5 ms ; n = 62 ; P < 0 . 0001 ) .|Patch clamp assessment of CACNA1C - p . R518C hiPSC - CMs paced at 1 Hz confirmed a prolonged APD90 ( 689 + - 29 ms ; n = 10 ) compared with the patient 's isogenic control hiPSC - CMs ( 434 + - 30 ms ; n = 8 ; P < 0 . 05 ) .|Fluo - 4 - measured calcium transient decay time suggested calcium mishandling in CACNA1C - p . R518C .|Patch clamp analysis revealed increased L - type calcium channel window current , slow decay time at various voltages , and increased late calcium current for CACNA1C - p . R518C hiPSC - CMs when compared with isogenic control hiPSC - CMs .|CONCLUSIONS : Using patient - specific hiPSC - CM mutant and isogenic control lines , we demonstrate that the CACNA1C - p .

31649580	The Association Between Schizophrenia Risk Variants and Creativity in Healthy Han Chinese Subjects .|Although previous evidence has suggested that there is a genetic link between schizophrenia and creativity , the specific genetic variants that underlie the link are still largely unknown .|To further explore the potential genetic link between schizophrenia and creativity , in a sample of 580 healthy Han Chinese subjects , this study aimed to ( 1 ) validate the role of Neuregulin 1 ( NRG1 ) rs6994992 ( one schizophrenia risk variant that has been previously linked to creativity in the European population ) in the relationship between schizophrenia and creativity and ( 2 ) explore the associations between 10 other schizophrenia risk variants and creativity .|For NRG1 rs6994992 , the result validated its association with creativity measures .|However , since NRG1 rs6994992 is not a schizophrenia risk variant in the Han Chinese population , the validated association suggested that ethnic difference may exist in the relationship between NRG1 rs6994992 , schizophrenia and creativity .|For other schizophrenia risk variants , the result only demonstrated a nominal association between ZNF536 rs2053079 and creativity measures which would not survive correction for multiple testing .|No association between polygenic risk score for these 10 schizophrenia risk variants and creativity measures was observed .|In conclusion , this study provides limited evidence for the associations between these schizophrenia risk variants and creativity in healthy Han Chinese subjects .|Future studies are warranted to better understand the potential genetic link between schizophrenia and creativity .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	168-169	166-167	rs6994992	rs6994992|rs6994992|rs6994992|rs6994992	SNP	81:124:139:166	82:125:140:167	2:3:4:4	D012559	Schizophrenia|schizophrenia|schizophrenia|schizophrenia|schizophrenia|schizophrenia|schizophrenia|schizophrenia|schizophrenia|schizophrenia|schizophrenia|schizophrenia	Disease	3:26:51:84:103:116:143:168:174:209:231:254	4:27:52:85:104:117:144:169:175:210:232:255	0:1:2:2:2:2:4:4:5:6:7:8	3084	None	1:VDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	187-188	174-175	rs2053079	rs2053079	SNP	187	188	5	D012559	Schizophrenia|schizophrenia|schizophrenia|schizophrenia|schizophrenia|schizophrenia|schizophrenia|schizophrenia|schizophrenia|schizophrenia|schizophrenia|schizophrenia	Disease	3:26:51:84:103:116:143:168:174:209:231:254	4:27:52:85:104:117:144:169:175:210:232:255	0:1:2:2:2:2:4:4:5:6:7:8	9745	None
31654490	HSD10 mitochondrial disease : p . Leu122Val variant , mild clinical phenotype , and founder effect in French - Canadian patients from Quebec .|BACKGROUND : HSD10 mitochondrial disease ( HSD10MD ) , originally described as a deficiency of 2 - methyl - 3 - hydroxybutyryl - CoA dehydrogenase ( MHBD ) , is a rare X - linked disorder of a moonlighting protein encoded by the HSD17B10 .|The diagnosis is usually first suspected on finding elevated isoleucine degradation metabolites in urine , reflecting decreased MHBD activity .|However , it is now known that clinical disease pathogenesis reflects other independent functions of the HSD10 protein ; particularly its essential role in mitochondrial transcript processing and tRNA maturation .|The classical phenotype of HSD10MD in affected males is an infantile - onset progressive neurodegenerative disorder associated with severe mitochondrial dysfunction .|PATIENTS , METHODS , AND RESULTS : In four unrelated families , we identified index patients with MHBD deficiency , which implied a diagnosis of HSD10MD .|Each index patient was independently investigated because of neurological or developmental concerns .|All had persistent elevations of urinary 2 - methyl - 3 - hydroxybutyric acid and tiglylglycine .|Analysis of HSD17B10 identified a single missense variant , c . 364C > G , p . Leu122Val , in each case .|This rare variant ( 1 / 183336 alleles in gnomAD ) was previously reported in one Dutch patient and was described as pathogenic .|The geographic origins of our families and results of haplotype analysis together provide evidence of a founder effect for this variant in Quebec .|Notably , we identified an asymptomatic hemizygous adult male in one family , while a second independent genetic disorder contributed substantially to the clinical phenotypes observed in probands from two other families .|CONCLUSION : The phenotype associated with p . Leu122Val in HSD17B10 currently appears to be attenuated and nonprogressive .|This report widens the spectrum of phenotypic severity of HSD10MD and contributes to genotype - phenotype correlation .|At present , we consider p . Leu122Val a " variant of uncertain significance . " Nonetheless , careful follow - up of our patients remains advisable , to assess long - term clinical course and ensure appropriate management .|It will also be important to identify other potential patients in our population and to characterize their phenotype .	1:VDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	4-7	0-3	rs28935476	p .

31659433	Phenome - wide association study of TTR and RBP4 genes in 361 , 194 individuals reveals novel insights in the genetics of hereditary and wildtype transthyretin amyloidoses .|Transthyretin ( TTR ) gene has a causal role in a hereditary form of amyloidosis ( ATTRm ) and is potentially involved in the risk of wild - type transthyretin amyloidosis ( ATTRwt ) .|To understand the genetics of ATTRm and ATTRwt , we conducted a phenome - wide association study of TTR gene in 361 , 194 participants of European descent testing coding and non - coding variants .|Among the 382 clinically relevant phenotypes tested , TTR non - coding variants were associated with 26 phenotypic traits after multiple testing correction .|These included signs related to both ATTRm and ATTRwt such as chronic ischaemic heart disease ( rs140226130 , p = 2 . 00 x 10 - 6 ) , heart failure ( rs73956431 , p = 2 . 74 x 10 - 6 ) , atrial fibrillation ( rs10163755 , p = 4 . 63 x 10 - 6 ) , dysphagia ( rs2949506 , p = 3 . 95 x 10 - 6 ) , intestine diseases ( rs970866 , p = 7 . 14 x 10 - 6 ) and anxiety ( rs554521234 , p = 8 . 85 x 10 - 6 ) .|Consistent results were observed for TTR disease - causing mutation Val122Ile ( rs76992529 ) with respect to carpal tunnel syndrome ( p = 6 . 41 x 10 - 6 ) and mononeuropathies of upper limbs ( p = 1 . 22 x 10 - 5 ) .|Sex differences were also observed in line with ATTRm and ATTRwt epidemiology .|Additionally , we explored possible modifier genes related to TTR function , observing convergent associations of RBP4 variants with the clinical phenotypes associated with TTR locus .|In conclusion , we provide novel insights regarding the molecular basis of ATTRm and ATTRwt based on large - scale cohort , expanding our understanding of the phenotypic spectrum associated with TTR gene variation

31781678	Computational Analysis of nsSNPs of ADA Gene in Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Using Molecular Modeling and Dynamics Simulation .|Severe combined immunodeficiency ( SCID ) is the most severe form of primary immunodeficiency ( PID ) , characterized by fatal opportunistic infections .|The ADA gene encodes adenosine deaminase , an enzyme that catalyzes the irreversible deamination of adenosine and deoxyadenosine in the catabolic pathway of purine .|Mutations of the ADA gene have been identified in patients with severe combined immunodeficiency .|In this study , we performed a bioinformatics analysis of the human ADA gene to identify potentially harmful nonsynonymous SNPs and their effect on protein structure and stability .|Using eleven prediction tools , we identified 15 nsSNPs ( H15D , H15P , H17Q , H17Y , D19N , T26I , G140E , C153F , A183D , G216R , H258Y , C262Y , S291L , S291W , and K34OE ) as harmful .|The results of ConSurf 's analysis revealed that all these nsSNPs are localised in the highly conserved positions and affect the structure of the native proteins .|In addition , our computational analysis showed that the H15D , G140E , G216R , and S291L mutations identified as being associated with severe combined immunodeficiency affect protein structure .|Similarly , the results of the analyses of Rmsd , Rmsf , and Rg showed that all these factors influence protein stability , flexibility , and compaction with different levels of impact .|This study is the first comprehensive computational analysis of nsSNPs of the ADA gene .|However , functional analyses are needed to elucidate the biological mechanisms of these polymorphisms in severe combined immunodeficiency

Ile269Asn ( rs79783591 ) mutation may have arisen in modern human populations from a founder event in native Mexicans .|The MC4R Isoleucine 269 is perfectly conserved across 184 species , which suggests a critical role for the amino acid in MC4R activity .|Four in silico tools ( SIFT , PolyPhen - 2 , CADD , MutPred2 ) predicted a deleterious impact of the p .
