The treatment was successful , with normalization of her symptoms and laboratory parameters within four weeks .|CONCLUSION : There has been a vast expansion in the understanding of the wide range of phenotypes associated with cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator dysfunction since the discovery of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene .|The genotype - phenotype correlation in pancreatitis is rare compared to other organ manifestations , since this is seen almost exclusively among pancreatic sufficient patients with cystic fibrosis .|Our study supports that compound heterozygosis F508 - R1438W / Y1032C is a ' cystic fibrosis - causing genotype ' characterized by an immunoreactive trypsinogen positive screening , abnormal sweat chloride testing , and pancreatic sufficiency , with an increased risk of acute pancreatitis at an early age .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	99-100	96-97	rs397508711	R1438W|R1438|R1438W|R1438W	ProteinMutation	11:99:155:339	12:100:156:340	0:4:5:12	D010195	pancreatitis|pancreatitis|pancreatic sufficiency|pancreatitis|pancreatic sufficiency|pancreatic sufficiency|pancreatitis|pancreatitis|pancreatic sufficiency|pancreatitis	Disease	2:41:87:96:121:196:224:308:365:374	3:42:89:97:123:198:225:309:367:375	0:1:3:3:4:6:8:11:12:12	1080	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	101-102	96-97	rs144055758	Y1032C|Y1032|Y1032C|Y1032C	ProteinMutation	13:101:157:341	14:102:158:342	0:4:5:12	D010195	pancreatitis|pancreatitis|pancreatic sufficiency|pancreatitis|pancreatic sufficiency|pancreatic sufficiency|pancreatitis|pancreatitis|pancreatic sufficiency|pancreatitis	Disease	2:41:87:96:121:196:224:308:365:374	3:42:89:97:123:198:225:309:367:375	0:1:3:3:4:6:8:11:12:12	1080	None	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	11-12	14-16	rs397508711	R1438W|R1438|R1438W|R1438W	ProteinMutation	11:99:155:339	12:100:156:340	0:4:5:12	D003550	cystic fibrosis|cystic fibrosis|cystic fibrosis|cystic fibrosis	Disease	14:52:328:345	16:54:330:347	0:2:11:12	1080	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	79-83	99-100	rs397508711	R1438W|R1438|R1438W|R1438W	ProteinMutation	11:99:155:339	12:100:156:340	0:4:5:12	D003141	pictures of the disease	Disease	79	83	3	1080	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	155-156	214-216	rs397508711	R1438W|R1438|R1438W|R1438W	ProteinMutation	11:99:155:339	12:100:156:340	0:4:5:12	D015746	abdominal pain	Disease	214	216	7	1080	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	155-156	217-218	rs397508711	R1438W|R1438|R1438W|R1438W	ProteinMutation	11:99:155:339	12:100:156:340	0:4:5:12	D000855	anorexia	Disease	217	218	7	1080	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	155-156	219-220	rs397508711	R1438W|R1438|R1438W|R1438W	ProteinMutation	11:99:155:339	12:100:156:340	0:4:5:12	D005334	fever	Disease	219	220	7	1080	None	1:VDA:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	13-14	14-16	rs144055758	Y1032C|Y1032|Y1032C|Y1032C	ProteinMutation	13:101:157:341	14:102:158:342	0:4:5:12	D003550	cystic fibrosis|cystic fibrosis|cystic fibrosis|cystic fibrosis	Disease	14:52:328:345	16:54:330:347	0:2:11:12	1080	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	79-83	101-102	rs144055758	Y1032C|Y1032|Y1032C|Y1032C	ProteinMutation	13:101:157:341	14:102:158:342	0:4:5:12	D003141	pictures of the disease	Disease	79	83	3	1080	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	157-158	214-216	rs144055758	Y1032C|Y1032|Y1032C|Y1032C	ProteinMutation	13:101:157:341	14:102:158:342	0:4:5:12	D015746	abdominal pain	Disease	214	216	7	1080	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	157-158	217-218	rs144055758	Y1032C|Y1032|Y1032C|Y1032C	ProteinMutation	13:101:157:341	14:102:158:342	0:4:5:12	D000855	anorexia	Disease	217	218	7	1080	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	157-158	219-220	rs144055758	Y1032C|Y1032|Y1032C|Y1032C	ProteinMutation	13:101:157:341	14:102:158:342	0:4:5:12	D005334	fever	Disease	219	220	7	1080	None

23990666	Pleiotropic effects of the trichloroethylene - associated P81S VHL mutation on metabolism , apoptosis , and ATM - mediated DNA damage response .|BACKGROUND : The risk relevance of the P81S von Hippel - Lindau ( VHL ) gene hotspot mutation identified in clear cell renal cell carcinoma from individuals exposed occupationally to trichloroethylene ( TCE ) is not known .|VHL mutations in hereditary VHL syndrome strongly correlate with phenotypic associations , but specific sporadic mutations in VHL that uniquely alter its protein function may provide a selective growth advantage for somatic cells harboring these mutations .|METHODS : VHL deficient ( Vhl ( - / - ) ) mouse embryonic stem cells were generated that stably express wild - type , P81S , or R167Q human VHL protein .|Under hypoxic conditions , cell lines were examined for hypoxia - inducible transcription factor family ( HIF ) stabilization and E3 - ubiquitin ligase complex interactions .|In vivo , teratomas were examined for tumor size , proliferation , apoptosis , and immunohistochemistry and subjected to gene expression analysis .|Wild - type , R167Q , and P81S VHL - expressing teratomas were also exposed to 5 Gy ionizing radiation to quantify apoptotic response .|Proliferation and apoptosis and teratoma growth were analyzed by either Student t test or analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction .|All statistical tests were two - sided .|RESULTS : The P81S VHL mutation produces deregulation of HIF factors in cell culture but exhibits a growth advantage in the tumor microenvironment , in part because of suppression of apoptosis ( P81S mean = 0 . 9 % , 95 % confidence interval = 0 . 6 to 1 . 2 % ; WT mean = 7 . 6 % ; 95 % confidence interval = 6 . 4 to 8 . 8 % ; P < . 001 ) coupled with sustained proliferation .|Transcriptional analysis of P81S teratomas revealed the induction of metabolic pathways , antiapoptotic genes , and global suppression of key DNA damage response genes not observed in VHL wild - type or R167Q mutants .|In vivo irradiation exposure showed that P81S mutant is resistant to ionizing radiation - induced apoptosis .|CONCLUSIONS : The TCE - associated P81S VHL mutation can initiate a unique adaptive response required for selective tumor growth through pleiotropic effects on metabolic diversification , apoptosis suppression , and alteration of the DNA damage response .	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	7-8	8-9	rs104893829	P81S|P81S|P81S|P81S|P81S|P81S|P81S|P81S|P81S	ProteinMutation	7:30:123:188:238:267:324:362:379	8:31:124:189:239:268:325:363:380	0:1:3:6:9:9:10:11:12	D006623	VHL|VHL|VHL|VHL|VHL|VHL|VHL|VHL|VHL|VHL|VHL	Disease	8:36:61:65:78:100:128:189:239:348:380	9:37:62:66:79:101:129:190:240:349:381	0:1:2:2:2:3:3:6:9:10:12	7428	None	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	30-31	43-48	rs104893829	P81S|P81S|P81S|P81S|P81S|P81S|P81S|P81S|P81S	ProteinMutation	7:30:123:188:238:267:324:362:379	8:31:124:189:239:268:325:363:380	0:1:3:6:9:9:10:11:12	C538614	clear cell renal cell carcinoma	Disease	43	48	1	7428	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	123-124	140-141	rs104893829	P81S|P81S|P81S|P81S|P81S|P81S|P81S|P81S|P81S	ProteinMutation	7:30:123:188:238:267:324:362:379	8:31:124:189:239:268:325:363:380	0:1:3:6:9:9:10:11:12	D000860	hypoxia	Disease	140	141	4	7428	None	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	324-325	325-326	rs104893829	P81S|P81S|P81S|P81S|P81S|P81S|P81S|P81S|P81S	ProteinMutation	7:30:123:188:238:267:324:362:379	8:31:124:189:239:268:325:363:380	0:1:3:6:9:9:10:11:12	D013724	teratomas|teratomas|teratoma|teratomas	Disease	161:192:210:325	162:193:211:326	5:6:7:10	7428	None	1:VDA:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	256-257	267-268	rs104893829	P81S|P81S|P81S|P81S|P81S|P81S|P81S|P81S|P81S	ProteinMutation	7:30:123:188:238:267:324:362:379	8:31:124:189:239:268:325:363:380	0:1:3:6:9:9:10:11:12	D009369	tumor|tumor|tumor	Disease	165:256:391	166:257:392	5:9:12	7428	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	128-129	126-127	rs5030821	R167Q|R167Q|R167Q	ProteinMutation	126:185:353	127:186:354	3:6:10	D006623	VHL|VHL|VHL|VHL|VHL|VHL|VHL|VHL|VHL|VHL|VHL	Disease	8:36:61:65:78:100:128:189:239:348:380	9:37:62:66:79:101:129:190:240:349:381	0:1:2:2:2:3:3:6:9:10:12	7428	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	126-127	43-48	rs5030821	R167Q|R167Q|R167Q	ProteinMutation	126:185:353	127:186:354	3:6:10	C538614	clear cell renal cell carcinoma	Disease	43	48	1	7428	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	126-127	140-141	rs5030821	R167Q|R167Q|R167Q	ProteinMutation	126:185:353	127:186:354	3:6:10	D000860	hypoxia	Disease	140	141	4	7428	None	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	185-186	192-193	rs5030821	R167Q|R167Q|R167Q	ProteinMutation	126:185:353	127:186:354	3:6:10	D013724	teratomas|teratomas|teratoma|teratomas	Disease	161:192:210:325	162:193:211:326	5:6:7:10	7428	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	165-166	185-186	rs5030821	R167Q|R167Q|R167Q	ProteinMutation	126:185:353	127:186:354	3:6:10	D009369	tumor|tumor|tumor	Disease	165:256:391	166:257:392	5:9:12	7428	None
24014609	Epistasis between IGF2R and ADAMTS19 polymorphisms associates with premature ovarian failure .|STUDY QUESTION : Do single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) or synergistic interactions between SNPs and diplotypes within the insulin - like growth factor 2 receptor ( IGF2R ) and ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif , 19 ( ADAMTS19 ) , contribute to premature ovarian failure ( POF ) ? SUMMARY ANSWER : Synergistic interactions were detected between SNPs , including a non - synonymous SNP , and diplotypes within IGF2R and ADAMTS19 which may contribute to POF ; however , there was no correlation with POF in a single SNP model after Bonferroni correction .|WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY : IGF2R regulates free IGF2 level , which is involved in steroidogenesis in bovine granulosa cells .|ADAMTS19 expression is higher in the murine embryonic ovary than in the embryonic testis during sexual differentiation , and an ADAMTS19 SNP ( rs246246 ) showed a possible association with POF in a genome - wide association study in Caucasian women .|STUDY DESIGN , SIZE , DURATION : This study analyzed interactions between SNPs and diplotypes within IGF2R and ADAMTS19 as well as SNPs within the two genes .|In Stage I , a total of 120 patients with POF and 152 female controls were recruited .|All patients were diagnosed with POF at the CHA hospital in Seoul , Korea , and were recruited between 1994 and 2004 .|The 152 controls were recruited from Chungju , Korea , as part of another study that was conducted from April 2002 to March 2004 .|For Stage II , we obtained genotype data for an additional 1641 female controls , recruited in Ansung and Ansan from 2001 to 2008 , from the Korean Genome Epidemiology Study ( KoGES ) .|PARTICIPANTS / MATERIALS , SETTING , METHODS : In Stage I , the GoldenGate assay with VeraCode technology was used to genotype SNPs in IGF2R and ADAMTS19 .|In Stage II , we obtained genotype data for IGF2R and ADAMTS19 using Affymetrix Genome - Wide Human SNP array 5 . 0 and imputed data by the IMPUTE program from the KoGES .|To identify POF - associated SNPs , logistic regression analysis in an additive model was performed using the PLINK tool .|Synergistic interactions between SNPs and diplotypes within IGF2R and ADAMTS19 were analyzed by logistic regression analysis in three alternative models .|MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE : In Stage I , 13 combinations of SNPs showed significant synergistic interactions after Bonferroni correction [ the strongest association had odds ratio ( OR ) = 5 . 77 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 2 . 26 - 14 . 75 , P = 0 . 00025 ] .|In Stage II and combined analyses , two and four combinations , respectively , of the significant results in Stage I showed significant synergistic interactions after Bonferroni correction .|For interactions between diplotypes in block 2 of IGF2R and block 3 of ADAMTS19 in Stage I , we found 17 synergistic interactions with P < 0 . 0001 , but there was no significant interaction after Bonferroni correction .|In Stage II and combined analyses , we found that three and seven combinations in the same blocks , respectively , showed significant synergistic interactions after Bonferroni correction ( strongest association : OR = 4 . 12 , 95 % CI : 2 . 22 - 7 . 62 , P = 6 . 74E - 06 ) .|LIMITATIONS , REASONS FOR CAUTION : The sample size for patients with POF in this study was small but , compared with recent reports describing associations between SNPs and POF and considering the low prevalence of POF ( 1 % ) , the sample size is considered to be reasonable .|These results should be confirmed in large - scale studies involving different ethnic groups .|WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS : Our results may ultimately provide predictive markers for women at a high risk of POF .|STUDY FUNDING / COMPETING INTERESTS : This study was supported by grants from Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea ( NRF ) , which is funded by the Ministry of Education ( 2009 - 0093821 , 2011 - 0010637 ) .|There are no competing interests .	1:VDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	161-162	154-155	rs246246	rs246246	SNP	154	155	3	D016649	premature ovarian failure|premature ovarian failure|POF|POF|POF|POF|POF|POF|POF|POF|POF|POF|POF	Disease	8:57:61:91:100:161:211:224:366:607:624:631:681	11:60:62:92:101:162:212:225:367:608:625:632:682	0:1:1:1:1:3:5:6:11:17:17:17:19	171019	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	154-155	138-140	rs246246	rs246246	SNP	154	155	3	D010051	embryonic ovary	Disease	138	140	3	171019	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	154-155	143-145	rs246246	rs246246	SNP	154	155	3	D013736	embryonic testis	Disease	143	145	3	171019	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	154-155	227-228	rs246246	rs246246	SNP	154	155	3	C483999	CHA	Disease	227	228	6	171019	None

Leu58 * ) in the BBIP1 gene .|This mutation is pathogenic since no BBIP1 protein could be detected in fibroblasts from the patient , and BBIP1 [ Leu58 * ] is unable to associate with the BBSome subunit BBS4 .|CONCLUSIONS : These findings identify BBIP1 as the 18th BBS gene ( BBS18 ) and suggest that BBSome assembly may represent a unifying pathomechanism for BBS .	1:VDA:2	R2L	CROSS	113-118	23-27	rs515726134	c . 173T > G	DNAMutation	113	118	3	D020788	Bardet - Biedl syndrome|Bardet - Biedl syndrome	Disease	3:23	7:27	0:1	92482	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	113-118	39-41	rs515726134	c . 173T > G	DNAMutation	113	118	3	C538365	retinitis pigmentosa	Disease	39	41	1	92482	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	113-118	42-43	rs515726134	c . 173T > G	DNAMutation	113	118	3	D009765	obesity	Disease	42	43	1	92482	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	113-118	44-46	rs515726134	c . 173T > G	DNAMutation	113	118	3	D007674	kidney dysfunction	Disease	44	46	1	92482	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	113-118	50-52	rs515726134	c . 173T > G	DNAMutation	113	118	3	D001523	behavioural dysfunction	Disease	50	52	1	92482	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	113-118	53-54	rs515726134	c . 173T > G	DNAMutation	113	118	3	D007006	hypogonadism	Disease	53	54	1	92482	None

10 ( IL10 ) cerebral malaria and hyperpyrexia .|Furthermore , IL17RE rs708567 GA and hHbS rs334 AT individuals were associated with protection from uncomplicated malaria and anaemia respectively in this study .|Meanwhile , individuals with the hHbS rs334 TT , IL10 rs3024500 AA , and IL17RD rs6780995 GA genotypes were more susceptible to severe malarial anaemia , cerebral malaria , and hyperpyrexia respectively .|Taken together , our results suggest that polymorphisms in some immune response genes may have important implications for the susceptibility to severe malaria in Cameroonians .|Moreover using uncomplicated malaria may allow us to identify novel pathways in the early development of the disease .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	209-210	196-197	rs708567	rs708567	SNP	196	197	6	D008288	malaria|malaria|malaria|malaria|malaria|malaria	Disease	12:100:172:209:272:279	13:101:173:210:273:280	0:3:5:6:8:9	None	None	1:VDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	209-210	200-201	rs334	rs334|rs334	SNP	200:223	201:224	6:7	D008288	malaria|malaria|malaria|malaria|malaria|malaria	Disease	12:100:172:209:272:279	13:101:173:210:273:280	0:3:5:6:8:9	None	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	227-228	209-210	rs3024500	rs3024500	SNP	227	228	7	D008288	malaria|malaria|malaria|malaria|malaria|malaria	Disease	12:100:172:209:272:279	13:101:173:210:273:280	0:3:5:6:8:9	3586	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	232-233	209-210	rs6780995	rs6780995	SNP	232	233	7	D008288	malaria|malaria|malaria|malaria|malaria|malaria	Disease	12:100:172:209:272:279	13:101:173:210:273:280	0:3:5:6:8:9	54756	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	196-197	21-23	rs708567	rs708567	SNP	196	197	6	D016778	falciparum malaria	Disease	21	23	1	None	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	200-201	21-23	rs334	rs334|rs334	SNP	200:223	201:224	6:7	D016778	falciparum malaria	Disease	21	23	1	None	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	227-228	21-23	rs3024500	rs3024500	SNP	227	228	7	D016778	falciparum malaria	Disease	21	23	1	3586	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	232-233	21-23	rs6780995	rs6780995	SNP	232	233	7	D016778	falciparum malaria	Disease	21	23	1	54756	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	196-197	31-33	rs708567	rs708567	SNP	196	197	6	D003141	infectious diseases	Disease	31	33	1	None	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	200-201	31-33	rs334	rs334|rs334	SNP	200:223	201:224	6:7	D003141	infectious diseases	Disease	31	33	1	None	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	227-228	31-33	rs3024500	rs3024500	SNP	227	228	7	D003141	infectious diseases	Disease	31	33	1	3586	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	232-233	31-33	rs6780995	rs6780995	SNP	232	233	7	D003141	infectious diseases	Disease	31	33	1	54756	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	196-197	169-170	rs708567	rs708567	SNP	196	197	6	D000755	HbS|HbS	Disease	151:169	152:170	4:5	None	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	200-201	169-170	rs334	rs334|rs334	SNP	200:223	201:224	6:7	D000755	HbS|HbS	Disease	151:169	152:170	4:5	None	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	227-228	169-170	rs3024500	rs3024500	SNP	227	228	7	D000755	HbS|HbS	Disease	151:169	152:170	4:5	3586	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	232-233	169-170	rs6780995	rs6780995	SNP	232	233	7	D000755	HbS|HbS	Disease	151:169	152:170	4:5	54756	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	196-197	188-190	rs708567	rs708567	SNP	196	197	6	D016779	cerebral malaria|cerebral malaria	Disease	188:243	190:245	5:7	None	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	200-201	188-190	rs334	rs334|rs334	SNP	200:223	201:224	6:7	D016779	cerebral malaria|cerebral malaria	Disease	188:243	190:245	5:7	None	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	243-245	227-228	rs3024500	rs3024500	SNP	227	228	7	D016779	cerebral malaria|cerebral malaria	Disease	188:243	190:245	5:7	3586	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	243-245	232-233	rs6780995	rs6780995	SNP	232	233	7	D016779	cerebral malaria|cerebral malaria	Disease	188:243	190:245	5:7	54756	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	196-197	191-192	rs708567	rs708567	SNP	196	197	6	D008305	hyperpyrexia|hyperpyrexia	Disease	191:247	192:248	5:7	None	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	200-201	191-192	rs334	rs334|rs334	SNP	200:223	201:224	6:7	D008305	hyperpyrexia|hyperpyrexia	Disease	191:247	192:248	5:7	None	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	247-248	227-228	rs3024500	rs3024500	SNP	227	228	7	D008305	hyperpyrexia|hyperpyrexia	Disease	191:247	192:248	5:7	3586	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	247-248	232-233	rs6780995	rs6780995	SNP	232	233	7	D008305	hyperpyrexia|hyperpyrexia	Disease	191:247	192:248	5:7	54756	None	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	196-197	211-212	rs708567	rs708567	SNP	196	197	6	D000740	anaemia|malarial anaemia	Disease	211:240	212:242	6:7	None	None	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	200-201	211-212	rs334	rs334|rs334	SNP	200:223	201:224	6:7	D000740	anaemia|malarial anaemia	Disease	211:240	212:242	6:7	None	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	240-242	227-228	rs3024500	rs3024500	SNP	227	228	7	D000740	anaemia|malarial anaemia	Disease	211:240	212:242	6:7	3586	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	240-242	232-233	rs6780995	rs6780995	SNP	232	233	7	D000740	anaemia|malarial anaemia	Disease	211:240	212:242	6:7	54756	None

V358Cfs34 * ) .|CONCLUSIONS : Mutations in GATA6 have been previously associated with pancreatic agenesis and congenital heart disease .|We conclude that , in addition to the heart and the pancreas , GATA6 is involved in development of two additional organs , the diaphragm and the pericardium .|In addition , we have shown that de novo mutations can contribute to the development of CDH , a common birth defect .	1:VDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	121-122	114-117	rs387906818	c . 1366C > T|p .

24388013	Genome - wide association analysis identifies 11 risk variants associated with the asthma with hay fever phenotype .|BACKGROUND : To date , no genome - wide association study ( GWAS ) has considered the combined phenotype of asthma with hay fever .|Previous analyses of family data from the Tasmanian Longitudinal Health Study provide evidence that this phenotype has a stronger genetic cause than asthma without hay fever .|OBJECTIVE : We sought to perform a GWAS of asthma with hay fever to identify variants associated with having both diseases .|METHODS : We performed a meta - analysis of GWASs comparing persons with both physician - diagnosed asthma and hay fever ( n = 6 , 685 ) with persons with neither disease ( n = 14 , 091 ) .|RESULTS : At genome - wide significance , we identified 11 independent variants associated with the risk of having asthma with hay fever , including 2 associations reaching this level of significance with allergic disease for the first time : ZBTB10 ( rs7009110 ; odds ratio [ OR ] , 1 . 14 ; P = 4 x 10 ( - 9 ) ) and CLEC16A ( rs62026376 ; OR , 1 . 17 ; P = 1 x 10 ( - 8 ) ) .|The rs62026376 : C allele associated with increased asthma with hay fever risk has been found to be associated also with decreased expression of the nearby DEXI gene in monocytes .|The 11 variants were associated with the risk of asthma and hay fever separately , but the estimated associations with the individual phenotypes were weaker than with the combined asthma with hay fever phenotype .|A variant near LRRC32 was a stronger risk factor for hay fever than for asthma , whereas the reverse was observed for variants in / near GSDMA and TSLP .|Single nucleotide polymorphisms with suggestive evidence for association with asthma with hay fever risk included rs41295115 near IL2RA ( OR , 1 . 28 ; P = 5 x 10 ( - 7 ) ) and rs76043829 in TNS1 ( OR , 1 . 23 ; P = 2 x 10 ( - 6 ) ) .|CONCLUSION : By focusing on the combined phenotype of asthma with hay fever , variants associated with the risk of allergic disease can be identified with greater efficiency .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	175-176	152-153	rs7009110	rs7009110	SNP	175	176	5	D001249	asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma	Disease	12:38:79:152:227:279:299:324:381	13:39:80:153:228:280:300:325:382	0:1:3:5:6:7:8:9:10	None	None	1:VDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	227-228	220-221	rs62026376	rs62026376|rs62026376	SNP	200:220	201:221	5:6	D001249	asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma	Disease	12:38:79:152:227:279:299:324:381	13:39:80:153:228:280:300:325:382	0:1:3:5:6:7:8:9:10	23274	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	330-331	324-325	rs41295115	rs41295115	SNP	330	331	9	D001249	asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma	Disease	12:38:79:152:227:279:299:324:381	13:39:80:153:228:280:300:325:382	0:1:3:5:6:7:8:9:10	None	None	1:VDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	351-352	324-325	rs76043829	rs76043829	SNP	351	352	9	D001249	asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma	Disease	12:38:79:152:227:279:299:324:381	13:39:80:153:228:280:300:325:382	0:1:3:5:6:7:8:9:10	7145	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	175-176	154-156	rs7009110	rs7009110	SNP	175	176	5	D006255	hay fever|hay fever|asthma without hay fever|hay fever|asthma and hay fever|hay fever|hay fever|asthma and hay fever|hay fever|hay fever|hay fever|hay fever	Disease	14:40:65:81:109:154:229:259:281:295:326:383	16:42:69:83:113:156:231:263:283:297:328:385	0:1:2:3:4:5:6:7:7:8:9:10	None	None	1:VDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	229-231	220-221	rs62026376	rs62026376|rs62026376	SNP	200:220	201:221	5:6	D006255	hay fever|hay fever|asthma without hay fever|hay fever|asthma and hay fever|hay fever|hay fever|asthma and hay fever|hay fever|hay fever|hay fever|hay fever	Disease	14:40:65:81:109:154:229:259:281:295:326:383	16:42:69:83:113:156:231:263:283:297:328:385	0:1:2:3:4:5:6:7:7:8:9:10	23274	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	330-331	326-328	rs41295115	rs41295115	SNP	330	331	9	D006255	hay fever|hay fever|asthma without hay fever|hay fever|asthma and hay fever|hay fever|hay fever|asthma and hay fever|hay fever|hay fever|hay fever|hay fever	Disease	14:40:65:81:109:154:229:259:281:295:326:383	16:42:69:83:113:156:231:263:283:297:328:385	0:1:2:3:4:5:6:7:7:8:9:10	None	None	1:VDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	351-352	326-328	rs76043829	rs76043829	SNP	351	352	9	D006255	hay fever|hay fever|asthma without hay fever|hay fever|asthma and hay fever|hay fever|hay fever|asthma and hay fever|hay fever|hay fever|hay fever|hay fever	Disease	14:40:65:81:109:154:229:259:281:295:326:383	16:42:69:83:113:156:231:263:283:297:328:385	0:1:2:3:4:5:6:7:7:8:9:10	7145	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	175-176	166-168	rs7009110	rs7009110	SNP	175	176	5	D004342	allergic disease|allergic disease	Disease	166:392	168:394	5:10	None	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	200-201	166-168	rs62026376	rs62026376|rs62026376	SNP	200:220	201:221	5:6	D004342	allergic disease|allergic disease	Disease	166:392	168:394	5:10	23274	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	392-394	330-331	rs41295115	rs41295115	SNP	330	331	9	D004342	allergic disease|allergic disease	Disease	166:392	168:394	5:10	None	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	392-394	351-352	rs76043829	rs76043829	SNP	351	352	9	D004342	allergic disease|allergic disease	Disease	166:392	168:394	5:10	7145	None

24645144	Epilepsy due to PNPO mutations : genotype , environment and treatment affect presentation and outcome .|The first described patients with pyridox ( am ) ine 5 ' - phosphate oxidase deficiency all had neonatal onset seizures that did not respond to treatment with pyridoxine but responded to treatment with pyridoxal 5 ' - phosphate .|Our data suggest , however , that the clinical spectrum of pyridox ( am ) ine 5 ' - phosphate oxidase deficiency is much broader than has been reported in the literature .|Sequencing of the PNPO gene was undertaken for a cohort of 82 individuals who had shown a reduction in frequency and severity of seizures in response to pyridoxine or pyridoxal 5 ' - phosphate .|Novel sequence changes were studied using a new cell - free expression system and a mass spectrometry - based assay for pyridoxamine phosphate oxidase .|Three groups of patients with PNPO mutations that had reduced enzyme activity were identified : ( i ) patients with neonatal onset seizures responding to pyridoxal 5 ' - phosphate ( n = 6 ) ; ( ii ) a patient with infantile spasms ( onset 5 months ) responsive to pyridoxal 5 ' - phosphate ( n = 1 ) ; and ( iii ) patients with seizures starting under 3 months of age responding to pyridoxine ( n = 8 ) .|Data suggest that certain genotypes ( R225H / C and D33V ) are more likely to result in seizures that to respond to treatment with pyridoxine .|Other mutations seem to be associated with infertility , miscarriage and prematurity .|However , the situation is clearly complex with the same combination of mutations being seen in patients who responded and did not respond to pyridoxine .|It is possible that pyridoxine responsiveness in PNPO deficiency is affected by prematurity and age at the time of the therapeutic trial .|Other additional factors that are likely to influence treatment response and outcome include riboflavin status and how well the foetus has been supplied with vitamin B6 by the mother .|For some patients there was a worsening of symptoms on changing from pyridoxine to pyridoxal 5 ' - phosphate .|Many of the mutations in PNPO affected residues involved in binding flavin mononucleotide or pyridoxal 5 ' - phosphate and many of them showed residual enzyme activity .|One sequence change ( R116Q ) , predicted to affect flavin mononucleotide binding and binding of the two PNPO dimers , and with high residual activity was found in Groups ( ii ) and ( iii ) .|This sequence change has been reported in the 1000 Genomes project suggesting it could be a polymorphism but alternatively it could be a common mutation , perhaps responsible for the susceptibility locus for genetic generalized epilepsy on 17q21 . 32 ( close to rs72823592 ) .|We believe the reduction in PNPO activity and B6 - responsive epilepsy in the patients reported here indicates that it contributes to the pathogenesis of epilepsy .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	239-242	0-1	rs550423482	R225H / C	ProteinMutation	239	242	6	D004827	Epilepsy|epilepsy|epilepsy	Disease	0:495:509	1:496:510	0:15:15	55163	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	243-244	0-1	rs370243877	D33V	ProteinMutation	243	244	6	D004827	Epilepsy|epilepsy|epilepsy	Disease	0:495:509	1:496:510	0:15:15	55163	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	495-496	404-405	rs17679445	R116Q	ProteinMutation	404	405	13	D004827	Epilepsy|epilepsy|epilepsy	Disease	0:495:509	1:496:510	0:15:15	55163	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	495-496	481-482	rs72823592	rs72823592	SNP	481	482	14	D004827	Epilepsy|epilepsy|epilepsy	Disease	0:495:509	1:496:510	0:15:15	None	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	239-242	76-78	rs550423482	R225H / C	ProteinMutation	239	242	6	C537806	oxidase deficiency|oxidase deficiency	Disease	30:76	32:78	1:2	55163	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	243-244	76-78	rs370243877	D33V	ProteinMutation	243	244	6	C537806	oxidase deficiency|oxidase deficiency	Disease	30:76	32:78	1:2	55163	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	404-405	76-78	rs17679445	R116Q	ProteinMutation	404	405	13	C537806	oxidase deficiency|oxidase deficiency	Disease	30:76	32:78	1:2	55163	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	481-482	76-78	rs72823592	rs72823592	SNP	481	482	14	C537806	oxidase deficiency|oxidase deficiency	Disease	30:76	32:78	1:2	None	None	1:VDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	251-252	239-242	rs550423482	R225H / C	ProteinMutation	239	242	6	D012640	seizures|seizures|seizures|seizures|seizures	Disease	36:112:171:217:251	37:113:172:218:252	1:3:5:5:6	55163	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	251-252	243-244	rs370243877	D33V	ProteinMutation	243	244	6	D012640	seizures|seizures|seizures|seizures|seizures	Disease	36:112:171:217:251	37:113:172:218:252	1:3:5:5:6	55163	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	404-405	251-252	rs17679445	R116Q	ProteinMutation	404	405	13	D012640	seizures|seizures|seizures|seizures|seizures	Disease	36:112:171:217:251	37:113:172:218:252	1:3:5:5:6	55163	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	481-482	251-252	rs72823592	rs72823592	SNP	481	482	14	D012640	seizures|seizures|seizures|seizures|seizures	Disease	36:112:171:217:251	37:113:172:218:252	1:3:5:5:6	None	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	239-242	191-193	rs550423482	R225H / C	ProteinMutation	239	242	6	D013036	infantile spasms	Disease	191	193	5	55163	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	243-244	191-193	rs370243877	D33V	ProteinMutation	243	244	6	D013036	infantile spasms	Disease	191	193	5	55163	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	404-405	191-193	rs17679445	R116Q	ProteinMutation	404	405	13	D013036	infantile spasms	Disease	191	193	5	55163	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	481-482	191-193	rs72823592	rs72823592	SNP	481	482	14	D013036	infantile spasms	Disease	191	193	5	None	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	239-242	267-268	rs550423482	R225H / C	ProteinMutation	239	242	6	D007247	infertility	Disease	267	268	7	55163	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	239-242	306-308	rs550423482	R225H / C	ProteinMutation	239	242	6	C566449	PNPO deficiency	Disease	306	308	9	55163	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	239-242	471-474	rs550423482	R225H / C	ProteinMutation	239	242	6	D030342	genetic generalized epilepsy	Disease	471	474	14	55163	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	243-244	267-268	rs370243877	D33V	ProteinMutation	243	244	6	D007247	infertility	Disease	267	268	7	55163	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	243-244	306-308	rs370243877	D33V	ProteinMutation	243	244	6	C566449	PNPO deficiency	Disease	306	308	9	55163	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	243-244	471-474	rs370243877	D33V	ProteinMutation	243	244	6	D030342	genetic generalized epilepsy	Disease	471	474	14	55163	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	404-405	267-268	rs17679445	R116Q	ProteinMutation	404	405	13	D007247	infertility	Disease	267	268	7	55163	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	481-482	267-268	rs72823592	rs72823592	SNP	481	482	14	D007247	infertility	Disease	267	268	7	None	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	404-405	306-308	rs17679445	R116Q	ProteinMutation	404	405	13	C566449	PNPO deficiency	Disease	306	308	9	55163	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	481-482	306-308	rs72823592	rs72823592	SNP	481	482	14	C566449	PNPO deficiency	Disease	306	308	9	None	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	404-405	471-474	rs17679445	R116Q	ProteinMutation	404	405	13	D030342	genetic generalized epilepsy	Disease	471	474	14	55163	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	481-482	471-474	rs72823592	rs72823592	SNP	481	482	14	D030342	genetic generalized epilepsy	Disease	471	474	14	None	None

Arg498Trp ) , which are associated with NS and NSML , respectively .|This boy 's phenotype is intermediate between NS and NSML with facial dysmorphism , short stature , mild global developmental delay , pulmonic stenosis , and deafness but absence of cafe au lait spots or lentigines .|The double - mutant SHP - 2 was found to be catalytically impaired .|This raises the question of whether clinical differences between NS and NSML can be ascribed solely to the relative SHP - 2 catalytic activity .	1:VDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	187-188	166-169	rs397507539	c . 1471C > T|p .

the MAPT haplotype modulated parietal activations associated with spatial rotations ; and APOE allelic variation influenced the magnitude of activation associated with memory encoding .|This study demonstrates that neurocognitive deficits are common even in recently diagnosed patients with Parkinson 's disease , and that the associated regional brain activations are influenced by genotype .|These data further support the dual syndrome hypothesis of cognitive change in Parkinson 's disease .|Longitudinal data will confirm the extent to which these early neurocognitive changes , and their genetic factors , influence the long - term risk of dementia in Parkinson 's disease .|The combination of genetics and functional neuroimaging provides a potentially useful method for stratification and identification of candidate markers , in future clinical trials against cognitive decline in Parkinson 's disease .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	240-241	230-233	rs4680	rs4680|rs4680	SNP	240:308	241:309	7:9	D010300	Parkinson 's disease|ICICLE - PD|Parkinson 's disease|ICICLE - PD|Parkinson 's disease|Parkinson 's disease|Parkinson 's disease|Parkinson 's disease|Parkinson 's disease|Parkinson 's disease|Parkinson 's disease|Parkinson 's disease	Disease	10:14:19:46:91:136:230:298:365:393:424:456	13:17:22:49:94:139:233:301:368:396:427:459	0:0:1:2:3:4:7:9:10:11:12:13	1312	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	249-250	230-233	rs9468	rs9468	SNP	249	250	7	D010300	Parkinson 's disease|ICICLE - PD|Parkinson 's disease|ICICLE - PD|Parkinson 's disease|Parkinson 's disease|Parkinson 's disease|Parkinson 's disease|Parkinson 's disease|Parkinson 's disease|Parkinson 's disease|Parkinson 's disease	Disease	10:14:19:46:91:136:230:298:365:393:424:456	13:17:22:49:94:139:233:301:368:396:427:459	0:0:1:2:3:4:7:9:10:11:12:13	4137	None	1:VDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	261-262	230-233	rs429358	rs429358	SNP	261	262	7	D010300	Parkinson 's disease|ICICLE - PD|Parkinson 's disease|ICICLE - PD|Parkinson 's disease|Parkinson 's disease|Parkinson 's disease|Parkinson 's disease|Parkinson 's disease|Parkinson 's disease|Parkinson 's disease|Parkinson 's disease	Disease	10:14:19:46:91:136:230:298:365:393:424:456	13:17:22:49:94:139:233:301:368:396:427:459	0:0:1:2:3:4:7:9:10:11:12:13	348	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	240-241	227-229	rs4680	rs4680|rs4680	SNP	240:308	241:309	7:9	D003072	multiple cognitive impairments|cognitive change|cognitive impairment|cognitive change|cognitive change|cognitive decline	Disease	25:59:88:227:390:453	28:61:90:229:392:455	1:2:3:7:11:13	1312	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	249-250	227-229	rs9468	rs9468	SNP	249	250	7	D003072	multiple cognitive impairments|cognitive change|cognitive impairment|cognitive change|cognitive change|cognitive decline	Disease	25:59:88:227:390:453	28:61:90:229:392:455	1:2:3:7:11:13	4137	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	261-262	227-229	rs429358	rs429358	SNP	261	262	7	D003072	multiple cognitive impairments|cognitive change|cognitive impairment|cognitive change|cognitive change|cognitive decline	Disease	25:59:88:227:390:453	28:61:90:229:392:455	1:2:3:7:11:13	348	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	422-423	308-309	rs4680	rs4680|rs4680	SNP	240:308	241:309	7:9	D003704	dementia|dementia	Disease	32:422	33:423	1:12	1312	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	422-423	249-250	rs9468	rs9468	SNP	249	250	7	D003704	dementia|dementia	Disease	32:422	33:423	1:12	4137	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	422-423	261-262	rs429358	rs429358	SNP	261	262	7	D003704	dementia|dementia	Disease	32:422	33:423	1:12	348	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	240-241	113-115	rs4680	rs4680|rs4680	SNP	240:308	241:309	7:9	D054220	cortical syndrome	Disease	113	115	3	1312	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	249-250	113-115	rs9468	rs9468	SNP	249	250	7	D054220	cortical syndrome	Disease	113	115	3	4137	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	261-262	113-115	rs429358	rs429358	SNP	261	262	7	D054220	cortical syndrome	Disease	113	115	3	348	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	308-309	355-357	rs4680	rs4680|rs4680	SNP	240:308	241:309	7:9	D019965	neurocognitive deficits	Disease	355	357	10	1312	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	249-250	355-357	rs9468	rs9468	SNP	249	250	7	D019965	neurocognitive deficits	Disease	355	357	10	4137	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	261-262	355-357	rs429358	rs429358	SNP	261	262	7	D019965	neurocognitive deficits	Disease	355	357	10	348	None

25176936	Common genetic variants contribute to primary hypertriglyceridemia without differences between familial combined hyperlipidemia and isolated hypertriglyceridemia .|BACKGROUND : The majority of hypertriglyceridemias are diagnosed as familial combined hyperlipidemia ( FCHL ) and primary isolated hypertriglyceridemias .|The contribution of common genetic variants in primary hypertriglyceridemias and the genetic difference between FCHL and isolated hypertriglyceridemias have not been thoroughly examined .|METHODS AND RESULTS : This study involved 580 patients with hypertriglyceridemias and 403 controls .|Of the 37 single nucleotide polymorphisms examined , 12 located in 10 genes showed allelic and genotype frequency differences between hypertriglyceridemias and controls .|The minor alleles of APOE , APOA5 , GALNTN2 , and GCKR variants were positively correlated with plasma triglycerides , whereas minor alleles of ADIPOR2 , ANGPTL3 , LPL , and TRIB1 polymorphisms were inversely associated .|Body mass index , glucose , sex , rs328 and rs7007797 in LPL , rs662799 and rs3135506 in APOA5 , and rs1260326 in GCKR explained 36 % of the variability in plasma triglycerides , 7 . 3 % of which was attributable to the genetic variables .|LPL , GCKR , and APOA5 polymorphisms fit dominant , recessive , and additive inheritance models , respectively .|Variants more frequently identified in isolated hypertriglyceridemias were rs7412 in APOE and rs1800795 in IL6 ; rs2808607 in CYP7A1 and rs3812316 and rs17145738 in MLXIPL were more frequent in FCHL .|The other 32 single nucleotide polymorphisms presented similar frequencies between isolated hypertriglyceridemias and FCHL .|CONCLUSIONS : Common genetic variants found in LPL , APOA5 , and GCKR are associated with triglycerides levels in patients with primary hypertriglyceridemias .|FCHL and isolated hypertriglyceridemias are probably trace to an accumulation of genetic variants predisposing to familial and sporadic hypertriglyceridemias or to hypertriglyceridemias and hypercholesterolemia in case of FCHL

25586784	Polycystic ovary syndrome susceptibility single nucleotide polymorphisms in women with a single PCOS clinical feature .|STUDY QUESTION : What is the direct genetic contribution of the polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) susceptibility single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) , identified by previous genome - wide association studies ( GWAS ) to the definitive clinical features of the syndrome ? SUMMARY ANSWER : Each single PCOS clinical feature had a specific genetic association , and rs4385527 in the chromosome 9 open reading frame 3 ( C9orf3 ) conferred a particular risk to the three defined PCOS clinical features in this study , which suggested its fundamental role in the etiology of PCOS .|WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY : PCOS is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by anovulation ( OA ) , hyperandrogenism ( HA ) and polycystic ovary morphology ( PCOM ) .|Two previous GWAS in China have identified 15 independent susceptibility SNPs related to PCOS ( PCOS - SNPs ) .|However , little is known about the candidate gene of each clinical feature .|STUDY DESIGN , SIZE , DURATION : Case - control study .|Three independent groups of women were recruited from 2010 to 2012 : 746 subjects with OA only , 278 subjects with HA only and 536 subjects with PCOM only .|A total of 1790 healthy women with none of the above pathological characteristics were also enrolled as control subjects during the same time period .|PARTICIPANTS / MATERIALS , SETTING , METHODS : All participants were women of reproductive age .|Genotype and allelic frequencies of 15 PCOS - SNPs were determined in all subjects using direct sequencing and Sequenom Arrays .|The allelic frequencies of each case group were compared with the controls .|MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE : After adjustment for age and BMI , variants in luteinizing hormone / choriogonadotropin receptor ( LHCGR ) ( rs13405728 ) , C9orf3 ( rs4385527 ) and insulin receptor gene ( INSR ) ( rs2059807 ) were strongly associated with OA ( Padjust < 0 . 01 , < 0 . 001 and < 0 . 05 , respectively ) ; rs4385527 in C9orf3 was strongly associated with HA ( Padjust < 0 . 001 ) ; variants in the thyroid adenoma associated gene ( THADA ) ( rs13429458 and rs12478601 ) , DENN / MADD domain containing 1A ( DENND1A ) ( rs10818854 ) , and C9orf3 ( rs4385527 ) were significantly associated with PCOM ( Padjust < 0 . 01 , < 0 . 001 , < 0 . 05 and < 0 . 001 , respectively ) .|LIMITATIONS , REASONS FOR CAUTION : The sample size of some case groups was relatively small , which therefore limited the statistical power of the analysis to a certain extent .|WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS : The present study indicates a potential common genetic basis of three PCOS clinical features .|Other specific associated genes may play a synergistic role , leading to heterogeneous pathophysiological changes .|Additionally , the increased frequency of PCOS - risk alleles in women with single PCOS clinical features suggests that these subjects have an elevated risk of developing the syndrome , although they can not be currently diagnosed .|STUDY FUNDING / COMPETING INTERESTS : This research was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China ( 973 Program ) ( 2012CB944700 , 2011CB944502 ) , the National Key Technology Research and Development Program ( 2011BAI17B00 ) , the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 81430029 , 81201441 , 81490743 , 31371453 ) , the Scientific Research Foundation of Shandong Province of Outstanding Young Scientist ( 2012BSE27089 ) and the Fundamental Research Funds of Shandong University ( 2014GN025 ) .|There were no competing interests .	1:VDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	76-77	66-67	rs4385527	rs4385527|rs4385527|rs4385527|rs4385527	SNP	76:325:362:410	77:326:363:411	1:11:11:11	D011085	Polycystic ovary syndrome|PCOS|polycystic ovary syndrome|PCOS|PCOS|PCOS|PCOS|PCOS|polycystic ovary|PCOS|PCOS|PCOS|PCOS|PCOS|PCOS	Disease	0:12:27:31:66:96:112:119:136:156:158:266:490:516:524	3:13:30:32:67:97:113:120:138:157:159:267:491:517:525	0:0:1:1:1:1:1:2:2:3:3:9:13:15:15	84909	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	320-321	266-267	rs13405728	rs13405728	SNP	320	321	11	D011085	Polycystic ovary syndrome|PCOS|polycystic ovary syndrome|PCOS|PCOS|PCOS|PCOS|PCOS|polycystic ovary|PCOS|PCOS|PCOS|PCOS|PCOS|PCOS	Disease	0:12:27:31:66:96:112:119:136:156:158:266:490:516:524	3:13:30:32:67:97:113:120:138:157:159:267:491:517:525	0:0:1:1:1:1:1:2:2:3:3:9:13:15:15	3973	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	335-336	266-267	rs2059807	rs2059807	SNP	335	336	11	D011085	Polycystic ovary syndrome|PCOS|polycystic ovary syndrome|PCOS|PCOS|PCOS|PCOS|PCOS|polycystic ovary|PCOS|PCOS|PCOS|PCOS|PCOS|PCOS	Disease	0:12:27:31:66:96:112:119:136:156:158:266:490:516:524	3:13:30:32:67:97:113:120:138:157:159:267:491:517:525	0:0:1:1:1:1:1:2:2:3:3:9:13:15:15	3643	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	490-491	389-390	rs13429458	rs13429458	SNP	389	390	11	D011085	Polycystic ovary syndrome|PCOS|polycystic ovary syndrome|PCOS|PCOS|PCOS|PCOS|PCOS|polycystic ovary|PCOS|PCOS|PCOS|PCOS|PCOS|PCOS	Disease	0:12:27:31:66:96:112:119:136:156:158:266:490:516:524	3:13:30:32:67:97:113:120:138:157:159:267:491:517:525	0:0:1:1:1:1:1:2:2:3:3:9:13:15:15	63892	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	490-491	391-392	rs12478601	rs12478601	SNP	391	392	11	D011085	Polycystic ovary syndrome|PCOS|polycystic ovary syndrome|PCOS|PCOS|PCOS|PCOS|PCOS|polycystic ovary|PCOS|PCOS|PCOS|PCOS|PCOS|PCOS	Disease	0:12:27:31:66:96:112:119:136:156:158:266:490:516:524	3:13:30:32:67:97:113:120:138:157:159:267:491:517:525	0:0:1:1:1:1:1:2:2:3:3:9:13:15:15	63892	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	490-491	404-405	rs10818854	rs10818854	SNP	404	405	11	D011085	Polycystic ovary syndrome|PCOS|polycystic ovary syndrome|PCOS|PCOS|PCOS|PCOS|PCOS|polycystic ovary|PCOS|PCOS|PCOS|PCOS|PCOS|PCOS	Disease	0:12:27:31:66:96:112:119:136:156:158:266:490:516:524	3:13:30:32:67:97:113:120:138:157:159:267:491:517:525	0:0:1:1:1:1:1:2:2:3:3:9:13:15:15	57706	None	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	362-363	369-370	rs4385527	rs4385527|rs4385527|rs4385527|rs4385527	SNP	76:325:362:410	77:326:363:411	1:11:11:11	D017588	hyperandrogenism|HA|HA|HA	Disease	131:133:210:369	132:134:211:370	2:2:6:11	84909	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	369-370	320-321	rs13405728	rs13405728	SNP	320	321	11	D017588	hyperandrogenism|HA|HA|HA	Disease	131:133:210:369	132:134:211:370	2:2:6:11	3973	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	369-370	335-336	rs2059807	rs2059807	SNP	335	336	11	D017588	hyperandrogenism|HA|HA|HA	Disease	131:133:210:369	132:134:211:370	2:2:6:11	3643	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	389-390	369-370	rs13429458	rs13429458	SNP	389	390	11	D017588	hyperandrogenism|HA|HA|HA	Disease	131:133:210:369	132:134:211:370	2:2:6:11	63892	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	391-392	369-370	rs12478601	rs12478601	SNP	391	392	11	D017588	hyperandrogenism|HA|HA|HA	Disease	131:133:210:369	132:134:211:370	2:2:6:11	63892	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	404-405	369-370	rs10818854	rs10818854	SNP	404	405	11	D017588	hyperandrogenism|HA|HA|HA	Disease	131:133:210:369	132:134:211:370	2:2:6:11	57706	None

25829473	A Brugada syndrome proband with compound heterozygote SCN5A mutations identified from a Chinese family in Singapore .|AIMS : Brugada syndrome ( BrS ) is a rare heritable ventricular arrhythmia .|Genetic defects in SCN5A , a gene that encodes the alpha - subunit of the sodium ion channel Nav1 . 5 , are present in 15 - 30 % of BrS cases .|SCN5A remains by far , the highest yielding gene for BrS .|We studied a young male who presented with syncope at age 11 .|This proband was screened for possible disease causing SCN5A mutations .|The inheritance pattern was also examined amongst his first - degree family members .|METHODS AND RESULTS : The proband had a baseline electrocardiogram that showed Type 2 BrS changes , which escalated to a characteristic Type I BrS pattern during a treadmill test before polymorphic ventricular tachycardia onset at a cycle length of 250 ms .|Mutational analysis across all 29 exons in SCN5A of the proband and first - degree relatives of the family revealed that the proband inherited a compound heterozygote mutation in SCN5A , specifically p . A226V and p . R1629X from each parent .|To further elucidate the functional changes arising through these mutations , patch - clamp electrophysiology was performed in TSA201 cells expressing the mutated SCN5A channels .|The p . A226V mutation significantly reduced peak sodium current ( INa ) to 24 % of wild type ( WT ) whereas the p . R1629X mutation abolished the current .|To mimic the functional state in our proband , functional expression of the compound variants A226V + R1629X resulted in overall peak INa of only 13 % of WT ( P < 0 . 01 ) .|CONCLUSION : Our study is the first to report a SCN5A compound heterozygote in a Singaporean Chinese family .|Only the proband carrying both mutations displayed the BrS phenotype , thus providing insights into the expression and penetrance of BrS in an Asian setting .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	189-192	138-139	rs199473561	p .

25940119	Diagnostic disparity and identification of two TNNI3 gene mutations , one novel and one arising de novo , in South African patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy and focal ventricular hypertrophy .|INTRODUCTION : The minimum criterion for the diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( HCM ) is thickening of the left ventricular wall , typically in an asymmetrical or focal fashion , and it requires no functional deficit .|Using this criterion , we identified a family with four affected individuals and a single unrelated individual essentially with restrictive cardiomyopathy ( RCM ) .|Mutations in genes coding for the thin filaments of cardiac muscle have been described in RCM and HCM with ' restrictive features ' .|One such gene encodes for cardiac troponin I ( TNNI3 ) , a sub - unit of the troponin complex involved in the regulation of striated muscle contraction .|We hypothesised that mutations in TNNI3 could underlie this particular phenotype , and we therefore screened TNNI3 for mutations in 115 HCM probands .|METHODS : Clinical investigation involved examination , echocardiography , chest X - ray and an electrocardiogram of both the index cases and close relatives .|The study cohort consisted of 113 South African HCM probands , with and without known founder HCM mutations , and 100 ethnically matched control individuals .|Mutation screening of TNNI3 for diseasecausing mutations were performed using high - resolution melt ( HRM ) analysis .|RESULTS : HRM analyses identified three previously described HCM - causing mutations ( p .

Leu144His mutation in three siblings with clinical RCM and varying degrees of ventricular hypertrophy .|The isolated index case with the de novo p . Arg170Gln mutation presented with a similar phenotype .|Both mutations were absent in a healthy control group .|CONCLUSION : We have identified a novel disease - causing p . Leu144His mutation and a de novo p . Arg170Gln mutation associated with RCM and focal ventricular hypertrophy , often below the typical diagnostic threshold for HCM .|Our study provides information regarding TNNI3 mutations underlying RCM in contrast to other causes of a similar presentation , such as constrictive pericarditis or infiltration of cardiac muscle , all with marked right - sided cardiac manifestations .|This study therefore highlights the need for extensive mutation screening of genes encoding for sarcomeric proteins , such as TNNI3 to identify the underlying cause of this particular phenotype .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	252-255	87-88	rs77615401	p .

26264712	Strong founder effect of p . P240L in CDH23 in Koreans and its significant contribution to severe - to - profound nonsyndromic hearing loss in a Korean pediatric population .|BACKGROUND : Despite the prevalence of CDH23 mutations in East Asians , its large size hinders investigation .|The pathologic mutation p . P240L in CDH23 is common in East Asians .|However , whether this mutation represents a common founder or a mutational hot spot is unclear .|The prevalence of CDH23 mutations with prelingual severe - to - profound sporadic or autosomal recessive sensorineural hearing loss ( arSNHL ) is unknown in Koreans .|METHODS : From September 2010 to October 2014 , children with severe - to - profound sporadic or arSNHL without phenotypic markers , and their families , were tested for mutations in connexins GJB2 , GJB6 and GJB3 .|Sanger sequencing of CDH23 p . P240L was performed on connexin - negative samples without enlarged vestibular aqueducts ( EVA ) , followed by targeted resequencing of 129 deafness genes , including CDH23 , unless p . P240L homozygotes were detected in the first screening .|Four p . P240L - allele - linked STR markers were genotyped in 40 normal - hearing control subjects , and the p . P240L carriers in the hearing - impaired cohort , to identify the haplotypes .|RESULTS : Four ( 3 . 1 % ) of 128 children carried two CDH23 mutant alleles , and SLC26A4 and GJB2 accounted for 18 . 0 and 17 . 2 % , respectively .|All four children showed profound nonsyndromic SNHL with minimal residual hearing .|Interestingly , all had at least one p . P240L mutant allele .|Analysis of p . P240L - linked STR markers in these children and other postlingual hearing - impaired adults carrying p . P240L revealed that p . P240L was mainly carried on a single haplotype .|CONCLUSIONS : p . P240L contributed significantly to Korean pediatric severe arSNHL with a strong founder effect , with implications for future phylogenetic studies .|Screening for p . P240L as a first step in GJB2 - negative arSNHL Koreans without EVA is recommended .	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	4-7	21-24	rs121908354	p . P240L|p . P240L|p . P240L|p . P240L|p . P240L|p . P240L|p .

26792595	Genetic susceptibility loci of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia do not represent risk for systemic sclerosis : a case control study in Caucasian patients .|BACKGROUND : Systemic sclerosis ( SSc ) - related interstitial lung disease ( ILD ) has phenotypic similarities to lung involvement in idiopathic interstitial pneumonia ( IIP ) .|We aimed to assess whether genetic susceptibility loci recently identified in the large IIP genome - wide association studies ( GWASs ) were also risk loci for SSc overall or severity of ILD in SSc .|METHODS : A total of 2571 SSc patients and 4500 healthy controls were investigated from the US discovery GWAS and additional US replication cohorts .|Thirteen IIP - related selected single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) were genotyped and analyzed for their association with SSc .|RESULTS : We found an association of SSc with the SNP rs6793295 in the LRRC34 gene ( OR = 1 . 14 , CI 95 % 1 . 03 to 1 . 25 , p value = 0 . 009 ) and rs11191865 in the OBFC1 gene ( OR = 1 . 09 , CI 95 % 1 . 00 to 1 . 19 , p value = 0 . 043 ) in the discovery cohort .|Additionally , rs7934606 in MUC2 ( OR = 1 . 24 , CI 95 % 1 . 01 to 1 . 52 , p value = 0 . 037 ) was associated with SSc -

26860843	Sensitive methods for screening of the MEK1 gene mutations in patients with central nervous system metastases of non - small cell lung cancer .|BACKGROUND : The mitogen - activated protein kinases 1 and 2 ( MEK1 , MEK2 ) are fundamental partners in the RAS - RAF - MEK - ERK pathway that is involved in regulation of cell proliferation , differentiation and survival .|Downregulation of the MEK cascades has been implicated in acquiring of the malignant phenotype in various cancers .|Somatic mutations in MEK1 gene ( substitutions K57N , Q56P , D67N ) were described in < 1 % of non - small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) and they were more commonly reported in adenocarcinoma patients with current or former smoking status .|MATERIALS AND METHODS : In the following study , we assessed the MEK1 gene mutations in 145 FFPE tissue samples from central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases of NSCLC using HRM - PCR and ASP - qPCR techniques .|The studied group was heterogeneous in terms of histopathology and smoking status .|The prevalence of the MEK1 gene mutation was correlated with the occurrence of mutations in KRAS , EGFR , DDR2 , PIK3CA , NRAS , HER2 , AKT1 and PTEN genes .|RESULTS : Using HRM and ASP - qPCR methods we identified one ( 0 . 7 % ; 1 / 145 ) MEK1 substitution ( Q56P ) in CNS metastases of NSCLC .|The mutation was identified in a single , 50 - year - old , current smoking men with adenocarcinoma ( 1 . 25 % ; 1 / 80 of all adenocarcinomas ) .|CONCLUSIONS : According to the current knowledge , the incidence of MEK1 gene mutation in CNS metastatic lesion of NSCLC is the first such report worldwide .|The analysis of gene profile in cancer patients may extend the scope of molecularly targeted therapies used both in patients with primary and metastatic tumors of NSCLC .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	104-110	91-92	rs869025608	K57N	ProteinMutation	91	92	3	D002289	metastases of non - small cell lung cancer|non - small cell lung cancer|NSCLC|NSCLC|NSCLC|NSCLC|NSCLC	Disease	15:104:111:158:245:299:333	23:110:112:159:246:300:334	0:3:3:4:7:9:10	5604	None	1:VDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	245-246	239-240	rs1057519729	Q56P|Q56P	ProteinMutation	93:239	94:240	3:7	D002289	metastases of non - small cell lung cancer|non - small cell lung cancer|NSCLC|NSCLC|NSCLC|NSCLC|NSCLC	Disease	15:104:111:158:245:299:333	23:110:112:159:246:300:334	0:3:3:4:7:9:10	5604	None	1:VDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	104-110	95-96	rs727504317	D67N	ProteinMutation	95	96	3	D002289	metastases of non - small cell lung cancer|non - small cell lung cancer|NSCLC|NSCLC|NSCLC|NSCLC|NSCLC	Disease	15:104:111:158:245:299:333	23:110:112:159:246:300:334	0:3:3:4:7:9:10	5604	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	91-92	82-83	rs869025608	K57N	ProteinMutation	91	92	3	D009369	cancers|cancer	Disease	82:313	83:314	2:10	5604	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	93-94	82-83	rs1057519729	Q56P|Q56P	ProteinMutation	93:239	94:240	3:7	D009369	cancers|cancer	Disease	82:313	83:314	2:10	5604	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	95-96	82-83	rs727504317	D67N	ProteinMutation	95	96	3	D009369	cancers|cancer	Disease	82:313	83:314	2:10	5604	None	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	91-92	120-121	rs869025608	K57N	ProteinMutation	91	92	3	D000230	adenocarcinoma|adenocarcinoma|adenocarcinomas	Disease	120:265:277	121:266:278	3:8:8	5604	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	91-92	156-157	rs869025608	K57N	ProteinMutation	91	92	3	D009362	metastases|metastases	Disease	156:243	157:244	4:7	5604	None	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	239-240	265-266	rs1057519729	Q56P|Q56P	ProteinMutation	93:239	94:240	3:7	D000230	adenocarcinoma|adenocarcinoma|adenocarcinomas	Disease	120:265:277	121:266:278	3:8:8	5604	None	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	239-240	243-244	rs1057519729	Q56P|Q56P	ProteinMutation	93:239	94:240	3:7	D009362	metastases|metastases	Disease	156:243	157:244	4:7	5604	None	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	95-96	120-121	rs727504317	D67N	ProteinMutation	95	96	3	D000230	adenocarcinoma|adenocarcinoma|adenocarcinomas	Disease	120:265:277	121:266:278	3:8:8	5604	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	95-96	156-157	rs727504317	D67N	ProteinMutation	95	96	3	D009362	metastases|metastases	Disease	156:243	157:244	4:7	5604	None
26863601	Influences of XDH genotype by gene - gene interactions with SUCLA2 for thiopurine - induced leukopenia in Korean patients with Crohn 's disease .|BACKGROUND : The impact of genetic variation in the thiopurine S - methyltransferase ( TPMT ) gene on thiopurine - induced leukopenia has been well demonstrated .|Although xanthine dehydrogenase ( XDH ) is the second major contributor to azathioprine breakdown , polymorphisms in XDH have rarely been studied in IBD patients .|We aim to access association between XDH variants and thiopurine - induced leukopenia by gene - gene interaction in a Crohn 's disease ( CD ) population .|STUDY : A total of 964 CD patients treated with thiopurines were recruited from a tertiary referral center .|The association between four XDH variants ( p . Gly172Arg , p . Asn1109Thr , p . Arg149Cys , and p . Thr910Lys ) and thiopurine - induced leukopenia was analyzed in cases with early leukopenia ( n = 66 ) , late leukopenia ( n = 264 ) , and in controls without leukopenia ( n = 632 ) .|Three non - synonymous SNPs , which we previously reported association with thiopurine - induced leukopenia , NUDT15 ( p . Arg139Cys ) , SUCLA2 ( p . Ser199Thr ) , and TPMT * 3C were selected for epistasis analysis with the XDH variants .|RESULTS : There was no significant association for two variants of XDH and thiopurine - induced leukopenia .|In the epistasis analysis , only XDH ( p . Asn1109Thr ) * SUCLA2 ( p . Ser199Thr ) showed a statistically significant association with early leukopenia [ odds ratio ( OR ) = 0 . 16 ; p = 0 . 03 ] .|After genotype stratification , a positive association on the background of SUCLA2 wild - type ( 199Ser ) between the XDH ( p . Asn1109Thr ) and early leukopenia ( OR = 4 . 39 ; p = 0 . 01 ) was detected .|CONCLUSION : Genes associated with thiopurine - induced leukopenia can act in a complex interactive manner .|Further studies are warranted to explore the mechanisms underlying the effects of the combination of XDH ( p . Asn1109Thr ) and SUCLA2 ( 199Ser ) on thiopurine - induced leukopenia .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	152-153	131-134	rs45523133	p .

26966274	Functional Analysis of a Novel Genome - Wide Association Study Signal in SMAD3 That Confers Protection From Coronary Artery Disease .|OBJECTIVE : A recent genome - wide association study meta - analysis identified an intronic single nucleotide polymorphism in SMAD3 , rs56062135C > T , the minor allele ( T ) which associates with protection from coronary artery disease .|Relevant to atherosclerosis , SMAD3 is a key contributor to transforming growth factor - beta pathway signaling .|Here , we seek to identify > = 1 causal coronary artery disease - associated single nucleotide polymorphisms at the SMAD3 locus and characterize mechanisms whereby the risk allele ( s ) contribute to coronary artery disease risk .|APPROACH AND RESULTS : By genetic and epigenetic fine mapping , we identified a candidate causal single nucleotide polymorphism rs17293632C > T ( D ' , 0 . 97 ; r ( 2 ) , 0 . 94 with rs56062135 ) in intron 1 of SMAD3 with predicted functional effects .|We show that the sequence encompassing rs17293632 acts as a strong enhancer in human arterial smooth muscle cells .|The common allele ( C ) preserves an activator protein ( AP ) - 1 site and enhancer function , whereas the protective ( T ) allele disrupts the AP - 1 site and significantly reduces enhancer activity ( P < 0 . 001 ) .|Pharmacological inhibition of AP - 1 activity upstream demonstrates that this allele - specific enhancer effect is AP - 1 dependent ( P < 0 . 001 ) .|Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments reveal binding of several AP - 1 component proteins with preferential binding to the ( C ) allele .|We show that rs17293632 is an expression quantitative trait locus for SMAD3 in blood and atherosclerotic plaque with reduced expression of SMAD3 in carriers of the protective allele .|Finally , siRNA knockdown of SMAD3 in human arterial smooth muscle cells increases cell viability , consistent with an antiproliferative role .|CONCLUSIONS : The coronary artery disease - associated rs17293632C > T single nucleotide polymorphism represents a novel functional cis - acting element at the SMAD3 locus .|The protective ( T ) allele of rs17293632 disrupts a consensus AP - 1 binding site in a SMAD3 intron 1 enhancer , reduces enhancer activity and SMAD3 expression , altering human arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation .	1:VDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	57-60	42-43	rs56062135	rs56062135|rs56062135	SNP	42:157	43:158	1:4	D003324	Coronary Artery Disease|coronary artery disease|coronary artery disease|coronary artery disease|coronary artery disease	Disease	17:57:89:113:339	20:60:92:116:342	0:1:3:3:11	4088	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	344-345	339-342	rs17293632	rs17293632|rs17293632|rs17293632|rs17293632|rs17293632	SNP	137:175:288:344:370	138:176:289:345:371	4:5:9:11:12	D003324	Coronary Artery Disease|coronary artery disease|coronary artery disease|coronary artery disease|coronary artery disease	Disease	17:57:89:113:339	20:60:92:116:342	0:1:3:3:11	4088	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	42-43	63-64	rs56062135	rs56062135|rs56062135	SNP	42:157	43:158	1:4	D050197	atherosclerosis|atherosclerotic	Disease	63:300	64:301	2:9	4088	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	300-301	288-289	rs17293632	rs17293632|rs17293632|rs17293632|rs17293632|rs17293632	SNP	137:175:288:344:370	138:176:289:345:371	4:5:9:11:12	D050197	atherosclerosis|atherosclerotic	Disease	63:300	64:301	2:9	4088	None

27111338	The Polymorphisms in LNK Gene Correlated to the Clinical Type of Myeloproliferative Neoplasms .|OBJECTIVE : LNK is an adapter protein negatively regulating the JAK / STAT cell signaling pathway .|In this study , we observed the correlation between variation in LNK gene and the clinical type of myeloproliferative neoplasms ( MPN ) .|METHODS : A total of 285 MPN cases were recruited , including essential thrombocythemia ( ET ) 154 cases , polycythemia vera ( PV ) 76 cases , primary myelofibrosis ( PMF ) 19 cases , and chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) 36 cases .|Ninety - three healthy individuals were used as normal controls .|V617F mutation in JAK2 was identified by allele - specific PCR method , RT - PCR was used for the detection of BCR / ABL1 fusion gene , and mutations and variations in coding exons and their flanking sequences of LNK gene were examined by PCR - sequencing .|RESULTS : Missense mutations of A300V , V402M , and R415H in LNK were found in 8 patients including ET ( 4 cases , all combined with JAK2 - V617F mutation ) , PV ( 2 cases , one combined with JAK2 - V617F mutation ) , PMF ( one case , combined with JAK2 - V617F mutation ) and CML ( one case , combined with BCR / ABL1 fusion gene ) .|The genotype and allele frequencies of the three SNPs ( rs3184504 , rs111340708 and rs78894077 ) in LNK were significantly different between MPN patients and controls .|For rs3184504 ( T / C , in exon2 ) , the T allele ( p . 262W ) and TT genotype were frequently seen in ET , PV and PMF ( P < 0 . 01 ) , and C allele ( p . 262R ) and CC genotype were frequently seen in CML ( P < 0 . 01 ) .|For rs78894077 ( T / C , in exon1 ) , the T allele ( p . 242S ) was frequently found in ET ( P < 0 . 05 ) .|For rs111340708 ( TGGGGx5 / TGGGGx4 , in intron 5 ) , the TGGGG x4 allele was infrequently found in ET , PMF and CML ( P < 0 . 01 ) .|CONCLUSION : Mutations in LNK could be found in some of MPN patients in the presence or absence of JAK2 - V617F mutation .|Several polymorphisms in LNK gene may affect the clinical type or the genetic predisposition of MPN

27187934	Genetic and environmental risk factors for atherosclerosis regulate transcription of phosphatase and actin regulating gene PHACTR1 .|BACKGROUND AND AIMS : Coronary artery disease ( CAD ) risk is associated with non - coding genetic variants at the phosphatase and actin regulating protein 1 ( PHACTR1 ) gene locus .|The PHACTR1 gene encodes an actin - binding protein with phosphatase regulating activity .|The mechanism whereby PHACTR1 influences CAD risk is unknown .|We hypothesized that PHACTR1 would be expressed in human cell types relevant to CAD and regulated by atherogenic or genetic factors .|METHODS AND RESULTS : Using immunohistochemistry , we demonstrate that PHACTR1 protein is expressed strongly in human atherosclerotic plaque macrophages , lipid - laden foam cells , adventitial lymphocytes and endothelial cells .|Using a combination of genomic analysis and molecular techniques , we demonstrate that PHACTR1 is expressed as multiple previously uncharacterized transcripts in macrophages , foam cells , lymphocytes and endothelial cells .|Immunoblotting confirmed a total absence of PHACTR1 in vascular smooth muscle cells .|Real - time quantitative PCR showed that PHACTR1 is regulated by atherogenic and inflammatory stimuli .|In aortic endothelial cells , oxLDL and TNF - alpha both upregulated an intermediate length transcript .|A short transcript expressed only in immune cells was upregulated in macrophages by oxidized low - density lipoprotein , and oxidized phospholipids but suppressed by lipopolysaccharide or TNF - alpha .|In primary human macrophages , we identified a novel expression quantitative trait locus ( eQTL ) specific for this short transcript , whereby the risk allele at CAD risk SNP rs9349379 is associated with reduced PHACTR1 expression , similar to the effect of an inflammatory stimulus .|CONCLUSIONS : Our data demonstrate that PHACTR1 is a key atherosclerosis candidate gene since it is regulated by atherogenic stimuli in macrophages and endothelial cells and we identify an effect of the genetic risk variant on PHACTR1 expression in macrophages that is similar to that of an inflammatory stimulus .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	295-296	268-269	rs9349379	rs9349379	SNP	268	269	11	D050197	atherosclerosis|atherosclerotic|atherosclerosis	Disease	6:113:295	7:114:296	0:5:12	221692	None	1:VDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	268-269	265-266	rs9349379	rs9349379	SNP	268	269	11	D003324	Coronary artery disease|CAD|CAD|CAD|CAD	Disease	21:25:69:87:265	24:26:70:88:266	1:1:3:4:11	221692	None

A total of 7 SNPs in the ASAP1 gene were genotyped in 1115 Western Chinese Han and 914 Tibetan population using an improved multiplex ligation detection reaction ( iMLDR ) method .|The associations of SNPs with TB risk and clinical phenotypes were determined based on the distributions of allelic frequencies and different genetic models .|A meta - analysis was carried out to further assess the relationship between ASAP1 polymorphism and TB risk . Statistical comparisons of cases and controls after correction for multiple testing did not yield any significant associations with the risk of TB via analyses of a single locus , haplotype , and subgroup differences .|Meta - analysis showed no evidence supporting association between rs10956514 and overall risk for TB .|Subsequent analysis referring to the genotypes of SNPs in relationship to clinical phenotypes identified that rs4236749 was associated with different serum C - reactive protein levels , suggesting a role of this locus in influencing the inflammatory state of Western Chinese Han patients with TB . Our present data revealed that ASAP1 polymorphisms are unlikely to confer susceptibility to TB in the Western Chinese Han and Tibetan populations , which challenges the promising roles of the ASAP1 gene in the development of TB and highlights the importance of validating the association findings across ethnicities .	1:VDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	55-56	45-46	rs4733781	rs4733781	SNP	45	46	2	D014376	Tuberculosis|tuberculosis|TB|TB|TB|TB|TB|TB|TB|TB|TB	Disease	11:55:57:99:142:177:201:229:275:290:313	12:56:58:100:143:178:202:230:276:291:314	0:2:2:3:4:5:5:6:7:7:7	50807	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	229-230	224-225	rs10956514	rs10956514|rs10956514	SNP	47:224	48:225	2:6	D014376	Tuberculosis|tuberculosis|TB|TB|TB|TB|TB|TB|TB|TB|TB	Disease	11:55:57:99:142:177:201:229:275:290:313	12:56:58:100:143:178:202:230:276:291:314	0:2:2:3:4:5:5:6:7:7:7	50807	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	246-247	229-230	rs4236749	rs4236749	SNP	246	247	7	D014376	Tuberculosis|tuberculosis|TB|TB|TB|TB|TB|TB|TB|TB|TB	Disease	11:55:57:99:142:177:201:229:275:290:313	12:56:58:100:143:178:202:230:276:291:314	0:2:2:3:4:5:5:6:7:7:7	50807	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	45-46	33-35	rs4733781	rs4733781	SNP	45	46	2	D007239	tuberculosis infection	Disease	33	35	1	50807	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	47-48	33-35	rs10956514	rs10956514|rs10956514	SNP	47:224	48:225	2:6	D007239	tuberculosis infection	Disease	33	35	1	50807	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	246-247	33-35	rs4236749	rs4236749	SNP	246	247	7	D007239	tuberculosis infection	Disease	33	35	1	50807	None

carriers , respectively ( OR = 2 . 66 , 95 % CI 1 . 39 - 5 . 07 , OR = 2 . 71 , 95 % CI 0 . 98 - 7 . 48 ) .|CONCLUSIONS : In contrast to some previous studies , these results support the role of the APOE E4 allele as an independent risk factor for ischemic stroke and ischemic coronary heart disease among Greek patients .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	136-137	106-107	rs6025	rs6025	SNP	136	137	3	D002544	Ischemic Stroke|ischemic stroke|IS|ischemic stroke|IS|IS|ischemic stroke|IS|IS|IS|IS|ischemic stroke	Disease	8:103:106:241:244:300:328:331:334:372:374:444	10:105:107:243:245:301:330:332:335:373:375:446	0:2:2:3:3:5:6:6:6:7:7:8	None	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	141-144	106-107	rs1799963	20210G > A|rs1799963	DNAMutation	141:145	144:146	3:3	D002544	Ischemic Stroke|ischemic stroke|IS|ischemic stroke|IS|IS|ischemic stroke|IS|IS|IS|IS|ischemic stroke	Disease	8:103:106:241:244:300:328:331:334:372:374:444	10:105:107:243:245:301:330:332:335:373:375:446	0:2:2:3:3:5:6:6:6:7:7:8	None	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	150-151	106-107	rs5985	V34L|rs5985	ProteinMutation	150:152	151:153	3:3	D002544	Ischemic Stroke|ischemic stroke|IS|ischemic stroke|IS|IS|ischemic stroke|IS|IS|IS|IS|ischemic stroke	Disease	8:103:106:241:244:300:328:331:334:372:374:444	10:105:107:243:245:301:330:332:335:373:375:446	0:2:2:3:3:5:6:6:6:7:7:8	2162	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	157-160	106-107	rs1801133	677C > T|A222V|rs1801133	DNAMutation	157:161:163	160:162:164	3:3:3	D002544	Ischemic Stroke|ischemic stroke|IS|ischemic stroke|IS|IS|ischemic stroke|IS|IS|IS|IS|ischemic stroke	Disease	8:103:106:241:244:300:328:331:334:372:374:444	10:105:107:243:245:301:330:332:335:373:375:446	0:2:2:3:3:5:6:6:6:7:7:8	4524	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	168-171	106-107	rs1801131	1298A > C|E429A|rs1801131	DNAMutation	168:172:174	171:173:175	3:3:3	D002544	Ischemic Stroke|ischemic stroke|IS|ischemic stroke|IS|IS|ischemic stroke|IS|IS|IS|IS|ischemic stroke	Disease	8:103:106:241:244:300:328:331:334:372:374:444	10:105:107:243:245:301:330:332:335:373:375:446	0:2:2:3:3:5:6:6:6:7:7:8	4524	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	241-243	191-192	rs1800790	- 455G > A|c . -

27640307	Recurrent De Novo and Biallelic Variation of ATAD3A , Encoding a Mitochondrial Membrane Protein , Results in Distinct Neurological Syndromes .|ATPase family AAA - domain containing protein 3A ( ATAD3A ) is a nuclear - encoded mitochondrial membrane protein implicated in mitochondrial dynamics , nucleoid organization , protein translation , cell growth , and cholesterol metabolism .|We identified a recurrent de novo ATAD3A c . 1582C > T ( p . Arg528Trp ) variant by whole - exome sequencing ( WES ) in five unrelated individuals with a core phenotype of global developmental delay , hypotonia , optic atrophy , axonal neuropathy , and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy .|We also describe two families with biallelic variants in ATAD3A , including a homozygous variant in two siblings , and biallelic ATAD3A deletions mediated by nonallelic homologous recombination ( NAHR ) between ATAD3A and gene family members ATAD3B and ATAD3C .|Tissue - specific overexpression of borR534W , the Drosophila mutation homologous to the human c . 1582C > T ( p . Arg528Trp ) variant , resulted in a dramatic decrease in mitochondrial content , aberrant mitochondrial morphology , and increased autophagy .|Homozygous null bor larvae showed a significant decrease of mitochondria , while overexpression of borWT resulted in larger , elongated mitochondria .|Finally , fibroblasts of an affected individual exhibited increased mitophagy .|We conclude that the p . Arg528Trp variant functions through a dominant - negative mechanism that results in small mitochondria that trigger mitophagy , resulting in a reduction in mitochondrial content .|ATAD3A variation represents an additional link between mitochondrial dynamics and recognizable neurological syndromes , as seen with MFN2 , OPA1 , DNM1L , and STAT2 mutations .	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	71-74	97-98	rs1057517686	c . 1582C > T|p .

27768276	Dnmt3b Methylates DNA by a Noncooperative Mechanism , and Its Activity Is Unaffected by Manipulations at the Predicted Dimer Interface .|The catalytic domains of the de novo DNA methyltransferases Dnmt3a - C and Dnmt3b - C are highly homologous .|However , their unique biochemical properties could potentially contribute to differences in the substrate preferences or biological functions of these enzymes .|Dnmt3a - C forms tetramers through interactions at the dimer interface , which also promote multimerization on DNA and cooperativity .|Similar to the case for processive enzymes , cooperativity allows Dnmt3a - C to methylate multiple sites on the same DNA molecule ; however , it is unclear whether Dnmt3b - C methylates DNA by a cooperative or processive mechanism .|The importance of the tetramer structure and cooperative mechanism is emphasized by the observation that the R882H mutation in the dimer interface of DNMT3A is highly prevalent in acute myeloid leukemia and leads to a substantial loss of its activity .|Under conditions that distinguish between cooperativity and processivity , we show that in contrast to that of Dnmt3a - C , the activity of Dnmt3b - C is not cooperative and confirm the processivity of Dnmt3b - C and the full length Dnmt3b enzyme .|Whereas the R878H mutation ( mouse homologue of R882H ) led to the loss of cooperativity of Dnmt3a - C , the activity and processivity of the analogous Dnmt3b - C R829H variant were comparable to those of the wild - type enzyme .|Additionally , buffer acidification that attenuates the dimer interface interactions of Dnmt3a - C had no effect on Dnmt3b - C activity .|Taken together , these results demonstrate an important mechanistic difference between Dnmt3b and Dnmt3a and suggest that interactions at the dimer interface may play a limited role in regulating Dnmt3b - C activity .|These new insights have potential implications for the distinct biological roles of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b .	1:VDA:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	141-142	153-156	rs147001633	R882H|R882H	ProteinMutation	141:219	142:220	5:7	D015470	acute myeloid leukemia	Disease	153	156	5	1788	None
27790247	Pleiotropic Meta - Analyses of Longitudinal Studies Discover Novel Genetic Variants Associated with Age - Related Diseases .|Age - related diseases may result from shared biological mechanisms in intrinsic processes of aging .|Genetic effects on age - related diseases are often modulated by environmental factors due to their little contribution to fitness or are mediated through certain endophenotypes .|Identification of genetic variants with pleiotropic effects on both common complex diseases and endophenotypes may reveal potential conflicting evolutionary pressures and deliver new insights into shared genetic contribution to healthspan and lifespan .|Here , we performed pleiotropic meta - analyses of genetic variants using five NIH - funded datasets by integrating univariate summary statistics for age - related diseases and endophenotypes .|We investigated three groups of traits : ( 1 ) endophenotypes such as blood glucose , blood pressure , lipids , hematocrit , and body mass index , ( 2 ) time - to - event outcomes such as the age - at - onset of diabetes mellitus ( DM ) , cancer , cardiovascular diseases ( CVDs ) and neurodegenerative diseases ( NDs ) , and ( 3 ) both combined .|In addition to replicating previous findings , we identify seven novel genome - wide significant loci ( < 5e - 08 ) , out of which five are low - frequency variants .|Specifically , from Group 2 , we find rs7632505 on 3q21 . 1 in SEMA5B , rs460976 on 21q22 . 3 ( 1 kb from TMPRSS2 ) and rs12420422 on 11q24 . 1 predominantly associated with a variety of CVDs , rs4905014 in ITPK1 associated with stroke and heart failure , rs7081476 on 10p12 . 1 in ANKRD26 associated with multiple diseases including DM , CVDs , and NDs .|From Group 3 , we find rs8082812 on 18p11 . 22 and rs1869717 on 4q31 . 3 associated with both endophenotypes and CVDs .|Our follow - up analyses show that rs7632505 , rs4905014 , and rs8082812 have age - dependent effects on coronary heart disease or stroke .|Functional annotation suggests that most of these SNPs are within regulatory regions or DNase clusters and in linkage disequilibrium with expression quantitative trait loci , implying their potential regulatory influence on the expression of nearby genes .|Our mediation analyses suggest that the effects of some SNPs are mediated by specific endophenotypes .|In conclusion , these findings indicate that loci with pleiotropic effects on age - related disorders tend to be enriched in genes involved in underlying mechanisms potentially related to nervous , cardiovascular and immune system functions , stress resistance , inflammation , ion channels and hematopoiesis , supporting the hypothesis of shared pathological role of infection , and inflammation in chronic age - related diseases

27820839	FTO Gene Polymorphism Is Associated with Type 2 Diabetes through Its Effect on Increasing the Maximum BMI in Japanese Men .|AIM : Several studies have demonstrated that polymorphisms within the fat - mass and obesity - associated gene ( FTO ) are associated with type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) .|However , whether the effects of the FTO locus on T2D susceptibility are independent of fat - mass increases remains controversial .|To investigate this issue , we examined the association of FTO variants with T2D and various aspects of BMI history during adult life in a Japanese population .|METHODS : We genotyped SNPs within FTO ( rs1121980 and rs1558902 ) in 760 Japanese patients with T2D who had reached a lifetime maximum BMI ( BMImax ) before or at the time of diagnosis and 693 control individuals with information regarding their BMImax .|RESULTS : The BMImax showed the strongest association with T2D risk among the BMIs evaluated in this study .|In the sex - combined analysis , FTO SNPs were not associated with any of the BMI variables or with T2D , but in sex - stratified analyses , both SNPs were significantly associated with the BMImax and rs1558902 was associated with T2D in men .|The association of the SNPs with T2D remained significant after adjustments for the current BMI and age , whereas the T2D association of the SNP was no longer significant after adjustments for BMImax and age .|CONCLUSIONS : These results suggest that the effects of FTO polymorphisms on T2D susceptibility in Japanese men are mediated through their effect on increasing the BMImax before or at the time of diagnosis .	1:VDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	119-120	110-111	rs1121980	rs1121980	SNP	110	111	4	D003924	Type 2 Diabetes|type 2 diabetes|T2D|T2D|T2D|T2D|T2D|T2D|T2D|T2D|T2D|T2D	Disease	6:45:49:62:87:119:156:186:208:218:232:260	9:48:50:63:88:120:157:187:209:219:233:261	0:1:1:2:3:4:5:6:6:7:7:8	79068	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	208-209	204-205	rs1558902	rs1558902|rs1558902	SNP	112:204	113:205	4:6	D003924	Type 2 Diabetes|type 2 diabetes|T2D|T2D|T2D|T2D|T2D|T2D|T2D|T2D|T2D|T2D	Disease	6:45:49:62:87:119:156:186:208:218:232:260	9:48:50:63:88:120:157:187:209:219:233:261	0:1:1:2:3:4:5:6:6:7:7:8	79068	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	110-111	35-36	rs1121980	rs1121980	SNP	110	111	4	D009765	obesity	Disease	35	36	1	79068	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	112-113	35-36	rs1558902	rs1558902|rs1558902	SNP	112:204	113:205	4:6	D009765	obesity	Disease	35	36	1	79068	None

28079315	Migraine Susceptibility Genes in Han Chinese of Fujian Province .|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE : Five single - nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) ( rs4379368 , rs10504861 , rs10915437 , rs12134493 and rs13208321 ) were recently identified in a Western population with migraine .|These migraine - associated SNPs have not been evaluated in a Han Chinese population .|This study investigated the associations of specific SNPs with migraine in a Han population .|METHODS : This was a case - control study of Han Chinese residing in Fujian Province .|Polymerase chain reaction - restriction - fragment - length polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing were used to characterize the relationships of SNPs in a control group of 200 subjects and in a migraine group of 201 patients .|RESULTS : The frequencies of the five SNPs did not differ between patients with migraine and healthy non migraine controls .|However , subgroup analysis indicated certain SNPs were more strongly associated with migraine with aura or migraine without aura than with controls .|The CT genotype of rs4379368 was more common in migraine patients with aura ( 75 % ) than in migraine patients without aura ( 47 . 9 % ) and controls ( 48 . 5 % ) ( p < 0 . 05 ) , and the TT genotype of rs10504861 was more common in migraine patients with aura than in controls ( 8 . 3 % vs . 0 . 5 % ) ( p < 0 . 05 ) .|Meanwhile , the CC genotype of rs12134493 was less common in migraine patients without aura than in controls ( 80 . 6 % vs . 88 % ) ( p < 0 . 05 ) .|CONCLUSIONS : Our findings suggest that the rs4379368 and

28381164	Association of ARID5B gene variants with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Yemeni children .|Studies have shown an association between ARID5B gene polymorphisms and childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia .|However , the association between ARID5B variants and acute lymphoblastic leukemia among the Arab population still needs to be studied .|The aim of this study was to investigate the association between ARID5B variants with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Yemeni children .|A total of 14 ARID5B gene single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) were genotyped in 289 Yemeni children , of whom 136 had acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 153 were controls , using the nanofluidic Dynamic Array ( Fluidigm 192 . 24 Dynamic Array ) .|Using logistic regression adjusted for age and gender , the risks of acute lymphoblastic leukemia were presented as odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals .|We found that nine SNPs were associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia under additive genetic models : rs7073837 , rs10740055 , rs7089424 , rs10821936 , rs4506592 , rs10994982 , rs7896246 , rs10821938 , and rs7923074 .|Furthermore , the recessive models revealed that six SNPs were risk factors for acute lymphoblastic leukemia : rs10740055 , rs7089424 , rs10994982 , rs7896246 , rs10821938 , and rs7923074 .|The gender - specific impact of these SNPs under the recessive genetic model revealed that SNPs rs10740055 , rs10994982 , and rs6479779 in females , and rs10821938 and rs7923074 in males were significantly associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia risk .|Under the dominant model , SNPs rs7073837 , rs10821936 , rs7896246 , and rs6479778 in males only showed striking association with acute lymphoblastic leukemia .|The additive model revealed that SNPs with significant association with acute lymphoblastic leukemia were rs10821936 ( both males and females ) ; rs7073837 , rs10740055 , rs10994982 , and rs4948487 ( females only ) ; and rs7089424 , rs7896246 , rs10821938 , and rs7923074 ( males only ) .|In addition , the ARID5B haplotype block ( CGAACACAA ) showed a higher risk for acute lymphoblastic leukemia .|The haplotype ( CCCGACTGC ) was associated with protection against acute lymphoblastic leukemia .|In conclusion , our study has shown that ARID5B variants are associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Yemeni children with several gender biases of ARID5B single nucleotide polymorphisms reported .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	157-158	149-152	rs7073837	rs7073837|rs7073837|rs7073837	SNP	157:252:293	158:253:294	6:9:10	D054198	acute lymphoblastic

28503092	Management of Gene Variants of Unknown Significance : Analysis Method and Risk Assessment of the VHL Mutation p . P81S ( c . 241C > T ) .|BACKGROUND : Evaluation of the pathogenicity of a gene variant of unknown significance ( VUS ) is crucial for molecular diagnosis and genetic counseling , but can be challenging .|This is especially so in phenotypically variable diseases , such as von Hippel - Lindau disease ( vHL ) . vHL is caused by germline mutations in the VHL gene , which predispose to the development of multiple tumors such as central nervous system hemangioblastomas and renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) .|OBJECTIVE : We propose a method for the evaluation of VUS pathogenicity through our experience with the VHL missense mutation c . 241C > T ( p . P81S ) .|METHOD : 1 ) Clinical evaluation of known variant carriers : We evaluated a family of five VHL p . P81S carriers , as well as the clinical characteristics of all the p . P81S carriers reported in the literature ; 2 ) Evaluation of tumor tissue via genetic analysis , histology , and immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) ; 3 ) Assessment of the variant 's impact on protein structure and function , using multiple databases , in silico algorithms , and reports of functional studies .|RESULTS : Only one family member had clinical signs of vHL with early - onset RCC .|IHC analysis showed no VHL protein expressed in the tumor , consistent with biallelic VHL inactivation .|The majority of in silico algorithms reported p . P81S as possibly pathogenic in relation to vHL or RCC , but there were discrepancies .|Functional studies suggest that p . P81S impairs the VHL protein 's function .|CONCLUSION : The VHL p . P81S mutation is most likely a low - penetrant pathogenic variant predisposing to RCC development .|We suggest the above - mentioned method for VUS evaluation with use of different methods , especially a variety of in silico methods and tumor tissue analysis .	1:VDA:2	L2R	CROSS	21-26	69-74	rs104893829	p .

28648751	The MUC5B promoter polymorphism and telomere length in patients with chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis : an observational cohort - control study .|BACKGROUND : Patients with hypersensitivity pneumonitis are at risk of developing pulmonary fibrosis , which is associated with reduced survival .|In families with multiple affected members , individuals might be diagnosed as having idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) or chronic ( fibrotic ) hypersensitivity pneumonitis , which suggests these disorders share risk factors .|We aimed to test whether the genomic risk factors associated with the development and progression of IPF are also associated with the development of fibrosis and reduced survival in people with chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis .|METHODS : We did an observational study of two independent cohorts of patients with chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis , one from the University of California San Francisco , CA , USA ( UCSF ) , and one from the University of Texas Southwestern , TX , USA ( UTSW ) .|We measured two common single - nucleotide polymorphisms associated with IPF ( MUC5B rs35705950 and TOLLIP rs5743890 ) and telomere length in peripheral blood leucocytes , and assessed their associations with chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis risk , survival , and clinical , radiographic , and pathological features .|We compared findings with those in patients with IPF from the UCSF and UTSW cohorts , and healthy controls from the European population of the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 , version 1 .|FINDINGS : The cohorts included 145 patients from UCSF and 72 from UTSW .|The minor allele frequency ( MAF ) was greater for MUC5B rs35705950 in patients with chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis than in healthy controls ( 24 4 % in UCSF and 32 3 % in UTSW vs 10 7 % , both p < 0 0001 ) , but not for TOLLIP rs5743890 .|The MAFs were similar to those for IPF ( UCSF 33 3 % , p = 0 09 ; UTSW 32 0 % , p = 0 95 ) .|In the combined UCSF and UTSW chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis cohort , we saw associations between extent of radiographic fibrosis and MUC5B rs35705950 minor alleles ( adjusted odds ratio [ OR ] 1 91 , 95 % CI 1 02 - 3 59 , p = 0 045 ) and short telomere length ( adjusted OR per unit change in mean natural logarithm - transformed ratio of telomere repeat copy number to single gene copy number 0 23 , 0 09 - 0 59 , p = 0 002 ) .|Telomere length less than the tenth percentile for age was also significantly associated with reduced survival ( log - rank p = 0 006 ) .|INTERPRETATION : The associations between MUC5B rs35705950 and short telomere length with extent of fibrosis , histopathological features of usual interstitial pneumonia , and reduced survival in patients with chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis suggest shared pathobiology with IPF , and might help to stratify risk .|FUNDING : National Institutes of Health and Nina Ireland Program for Lung Health .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	273-275	268-269	rs35705950	rs35705950|rs35705950|rs35705950|rs35705950	SNP	175:268:360:461	176:269:361:462	5:8:10:12	D000542	chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis|hypersensitivity pneumonitis|hypersensitivity pneumonitis|hypersensitivity pneumonitis|hypersensitivity pneumonitis|hypersensitivity pneumonitis|hypersensitivity pneumonitis|hypersensitivity pneumonitis cohort|hypersensitivity pneumonitis	Disease	10:25:66:109:127:194:273:346:485	13:27:68:111:129:196:275:349:487	0:1:2:3:4:5:8:10:12	None	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	194-196	178-179	rs5743890	rs5743890|rs5743890	SNP	178:307	179:308	5:8	D000542	chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis|hypersensitivity pneumonitis|hypersensitivity pneumonitis|hypersensitivity pneumonitis|hypersensitivity pneumonitis|hypersensitivity pneumonitis|hypersensitivity pneumonitis|hypersensitivity pneumonitis cohort|hypersensitivity pneumonitis	Disease	10:25:66:109:127:194:273:346:485	13:27:68:111:129:196:275:349:487	0:1:2:3:4:5:8:10:12	54472	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	175-176	32-34	rs35705950	rs35705950|rs35705950|rs35705950|rs35705950	SNP	175:268:360:461	176:269:361:462	5:8:10:12	D011658	pulmonary fibrosis	Disease	32	34	1	None	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	178-179	32-34	rs5743890	rs5743890|rs5743890	SNP	178:307	179:308	5:8	D011658	pulmonary fibrosis	Disease	32	34	1	54472	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	175-176	172-173	rs35705950	rs35705950|rs35705950|rs35705950|rs35705950	SNP	175:268:360:461	176:269:361:462	5:8:10:12	D054990	idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis|IPF|IPF|IPF|IPF|IPF|IPF	Disease	55:59:93:172:217:316:491	58:60:94:173:218:317:492	2:2:3:5:6:9:12	None	None	1:VDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	178-179	172-173	rs5743890	rs5743890|rs5743890	SNP	178:307	179:308	5:8	D054990	idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis|IPF|IPF|IPF|IPF|IPF|IPF	Disease	55:59:93:172:217:316:491	58:60:94:173:218:317:492	2:2:3:5:6:9:12	54472	None	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	360-361	357-358	rs35705950	rs35705950|rs35705950|rs35705950|rs35705950	SNP	175:268:360:461	176:269:361:462	5:8:10:12	D005355	fibrosis|fibrosis|fibrosis	Disease	101:357:469	102:358:470	3:10:12	None	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	357-358	307-308	rs5743890	rs5743890|rs5743890	SNP	178:307	179:308	5:8	D005355	fibrosis|fibrosis|fibrosis	Disease	101:357:469	102:358:470	3:10:12	54472	None	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	461-462	476-477	rs35705950	rs35705950|rs35705950|rs35705950|rs35705950	SNP	175:268:360:461	176:269:361:462	5:8:10:12	D011014	pneumonia	Disease	476	477	12	None	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	307-308	476-477	rs5743890	rs5743890|rs5743890	SNP	178:307	179:308	5:8	D011014	pneumonia	Disease	476	477	12	54472	None

28739605	Genetic variation in the gene LRP2 increases relapse risk in multiple sclerosis .|BACKGROUND : Due to the lack of prospective studies with longitudinal data on relapse , past genetic studies have not attempted to identify genetic factors that predict relapse risk ( the primary endpoint of many pivotal clinical trials testing the efficacy of multiple sclerosis ( MS ) disease - modifying drugs ) at a genome - wide scale .|METHODS : We conducted a genome - wide association analysis ( GWAS ) to identify genetic variants that predict MS relapse risk , using a three - stage approach .|First , GWAS was conducted using the southern Tasmania MS Longitudinal Study with 141 cases followed prospectively for a mean of 2 . 3 years .|Second , GWAS was conducted using the Ausimmune Longitudinal Study with 127 cases having a classic first demyelinating event followed for 5 years from onset .|Third , the top hits with p < 5 . 0x10 - 6 from the first two stages were combined with a longitudinal US paediatric MS cohort with 181 cases followed for 5 years after onset .|Predictors of time to relapse were evaluated by a mixed effects Cox model .|An inverse variance fixed effects model was then used to undertake a meta - analysis .|RESULTS : In the pooled results , using these three unique longitudinal MS cohorts , we discovered one novel locus ( LRP2 ; most significant single nucleotide polymorphism rs12988804 ) that reached genome - wide significance in predicting relapse risk ( HR = 2 . 18 , p = 3 . 30x10 - 8 ) .|LRP2 is expressed on the surface of many central nervous system cells including neurons and oligodendrocytes and is a critical receptor in axonal guidance .|CONCLUSIONS : The finding of a genetic locus that has extensive effects on neuronal development and repair is of interest as a potential modulator of MS disease course .	1:VDA:2	R2L	CROSS	249-250	55-57	rs12988804	rs12988804	SNP	249	250	8	D009103	multiple sclerosis|multiple sclerosis	Disease	10:55	12:57	0:1	4036	None

Ala275Asp Founder Mutation and Maternal Uniparental Disomy of Chromosome 22 .|BACKGROUND : Megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts ( MLC ) is a rare inherited disorder characterized by infantile - onset macrocephaly , slow neurologic deterioration , and seizures .|Mutations in the causative gene , MLC1 , are found in approximately 75 % of patients and are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner .|We analyzed MLC1 mutations in five unrelated Korean patients with MLC .|METHODS : Direct Sanger sequencing was used to identify MLC1 mutations .|A founder effect of the p . Ala275Asp variant was demonstrated by haplotype analysis using single - nucleotide polymorphic ( SNP ) markers .|Multiple ligation - dependent probe amplification ( MLPA ) and comparative genomic hybridization plus SNP array were used to detect exonic deletions or uniparental disomy ( UPD ) .|RESULTS : The most prevalent pathogenic variant was c . 824C > A ( p . Ala275Asp ) found in 7 / 10 ( 70 % ) alleles .|Two pathogenic frameshift variants were found : c . 135delC ( p . Cys46Alafs * 12 ) and c . 337_353delinsG ( p . Ile113Glyfs * 4 ) .|Haplotype analysis suggested that the Korean patients with MLC harbored a founder mutation in p . Ala275Asp .|The p . ( Ile113Glyfs * 4 ) was identified in a homozygous state , and a family study revealed that only the mother was heterozygous for this variant .|Further analysis of MLPA and SNP arrays for this patient demonstrated loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 22 without any deletion , indicating UPD .|The maternal origin of both chromosomes 22 was demonstrated by haplotype analysis .|CONCLUSIONS : This study is the first to describe the mutational spectrum of Korean patients with MLC , demonstrating a founder effect of the p . Ala275Asp variant .|This study also broadens our understanding of the mutational spectrum of MLC1 by demonstrating a homozygous p . ( Ile113Glyfs * 4 ) variant resulting from UPD of chromosome 22 .	1:VDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	16-19	10-12	rs764669598	p . Ala275Asp|p . Ala275Asp|c . 824C > A|p . Ala275Asp|p . Ala275Asp|p .

28968913	Functional non - synonymous variants of ABCG2 and gout risk .|Objectives : Common dysfunctional variants of ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 2 ( Junior blood group ) ( ABCG2 ) , a high - capacity urate transporter gene , that result in decreased urate excretion are major causes of hyperuricemia and gout .|In the present study , our objective was to determine the frequency and effect on gout of common and rare non - synonymous and other functional allelic variants in the ABCG2 gene .|Methods : The main cohort recruited from the Czech Republic consisted of 145 gout patients ; 115 normouricaemic controls were used for comparison .|We amplified , directly sequenced and analysed 15 ABCG2 exons .|The associations between genetic variants and clinical phenotype were analysed using the t - test , Fisher 's exact test and a logistic and linear regression approach .|Data from a New Zealand Polynesian sample set and the UK Biobank were included for the p . V12M analysis .|Results : In the ABCG2 gene , 18 intronic ( one dysfunctional splicing ) and 11 exonic variants were detected : 9 were non - synonymous ( 2 common , 7 rare including 1 novel ) , namely p . V12M , p . Q141K , p . R147W , p . T153M , p . F373C , p . T434M , p . S476P , p . D620N and p . K360del .|The p . Q141K ( rs2231142 ) variant had a significantly higher minor allele frequency ( 0 . 23 ) in the gout patients compared with the European - origin population ( 0 . 09 ) and was significantly more common among gout patients than among normouricaemic controls ( odds ratio = 3 . 26 , P < 0 . 0001 ) .|Patients with non - synonymous allelic variants had an earlier onset of gout ( 42 vs 48 years , P = 0 . 0143 ) and a greater likelihood of a familial history of gout ( 41 % vs 27 % , odds ratio = 1 . 96 , P = 0 . 053 ) .|In a meta - analysis p . V12M exerted a protective effect from gout ( P < 0 . 0001 ) .|Conclusion : Genetic variants of ABCG2 , common and rare , increased the risk of gout .|Non - synonymous allelic variants of ABCG2 had a significant effect on earlier onset of gout and the presence of a familial gout history .|ABCG2 should thus be considered a common and significant risk factor for gout .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	378-379	370-373	rs2231137	p .

29702976	NUDT15 R139C variation increases the risk of azathioprine - induced toxicity in Chinese subjects : Case report and literature review .|INTRODUCTION : Azathioprine ( AZA ) is widely used as an immunosuppressive agent , and its efficacy has been recommended by many clinical studies .|However , leukopenia , the most common toxicity , still restricts its clinical applications .|Recent studies found that NUDT15 R139C polymorphism is strongly associated with AZA - induced leukopenia in Koreans .|However , the follow - up studies available are all limited to inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) .|Here , we report a case of a Chinese patient with Sjogren syndrome ( SS ) with wild - type TPMT * 3C who was diagnosed with AZA - induced severe toxicity due to NUDT15 mutation based on clinical and laboratory characteristics .|CASE PRESENTATION : A 22 - year - old Chinese woman with SS developed severe leukopenia after AZA administration for 21 days .|Detection of 6 - thioguanine nucleotides ( 6 - TGN ) showed that the erythrocyte concentration had beyond the monitoring range , indicating that severe leukopenia might be caused by AZA .|Furthermore , gene sequencing showed that NUDT15 R139C ( poor metabolizer ) homozygosity might explain this adverse event .|Based on the evidence , AZA administration was immediately stopped and supportive treatments provided , and the patient eventually recovered .|CONCLUSION : In this report , we first provide detailed clinical and laboratory characteristics of AZA - induced leukopenia in a patient with SS with a mutant NUDT15 R139C genotype ( TT allele ) and normal TPMT activity .|This case indicates that NUDT15 R139C and TPMT * 3C genotypes , and more importantly , 6 - TGN levels , should be routinely monitored for those administered with AZA to predict and prevent AZA - induced toxicity .	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	1-2	10-11	rs116855232	R139C|R139C|R139C|R139C|R139C	ProteinMutation	1:66:203:264:280	2:67:204:265:281	0:3:8:10:11	D064420	toxicity|toxicity|toxicity|toxicity	Disease	10:53:129:312	11:54:130:313	0:2:5:11	55270	None	1:VDA:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	66-67	75-76	rs116855232	R139C|R139C|R139C|R139C|R139C	ProteinMutation	1:66:203:264:280	2:67:204:265:281	0:3:8:10:11	D007970	leukopenia|leukopenia|leukopenia|leukopenia|leukopenia	Disease	48:75:156:189:254	49:76:157:190:255	2:3:6:7:10	55270	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	66-67	91-94	rs116855232	R139C|R139C|R139C|R139C|R139C	ProteinMutation	1:66:203:264:280	2:67:204:265:281	0:3:8:10:11	D015212	inflammatory bowel disease|IBD	Disease	91:95	94:96	4:4	55270	None	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	259-260	264-265	rs116855232	R139C|R139C|R139C|R139C|R139C	ProteinMutation	1:66:203:264:280	2:67:204:265:281	0:3:8:10:11	D012859	Sjogren syndrome|SS|SS|SS	Disease	109:112:153:259	111:113:154:260	5:5:6:10	55270	None

29925524	Protein kinase C signaling dysfunction in von Willebrand disease ( p . V1316M ) type 2B platelets .|von Willebrand disease ( VWD ) type 2B is characterized by gain - of - function mutations in von Willebrand factor ( VWF ) , enhancing its binding affinity for the platelet receptor glycoprotein ( GP ) Ibalpha .|VWD type 2B patients display a bleeding tendency associated with loss of high - molecular - weight VWF multimers and variable thrombocytopenia .|We recently demonstrated that a marked defect in agonist - induced activation of the small GTPase , Rap1 , and integrin alphaIIbbeta3 in VWD ( p . V1316M ) type 2B platelets also contributes to the bleeding tendency .|Here , we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying impaired platelet Rap1 signaling in this disease .|Two distinct pathways contribute to Rap1 activation in platelets : rapid activation mediated by the calcium - sensing guanine nucleotide exchange factor CalDAG - GEF - I ( CDGI ) and sustained activation that is dependent on signaling by protein kinase C ( PKC ) and the adenosine 5 ' - diphosphate receptor P2Y12 .|To investigate which Rap1 signaling pathway is affected , we expressed VWF / p . V1316M by hydrodynamic gene transfer in wild - type and Caldaggef1 - / - mice .|Using alphaIIbbeta3 integrin activation as a read - out , we demonstrate that platelet dysfunction in VWD ( p . V1316M ) type 2B affects PKC - mediated , but not CDGI - mediated , activation of Rap1 .|Consistently , we observed decreased PKC substrate phosphorylation and impaired granule release in stimulated VWD type 2B platelets .|Interestingly , the defect in PKC signaling was caused by a significant increase in baseline PKC substrate phosphorylation in circulating VWD ( p . V1316M ) type 2B platelets , suggesting that the VWF - GPIbalpha interaction leads to preactivation and exhaustion of the PKC pathway .|Consistent with PKC preactivation , VWD ( p . V1316M ) type 2B mice also exhibited marked shedding of platelet GPIbalpha .|In summary , our studies identify altered PKC signaling as the underlying cause of platelet hypofunction in p .

29948574	T + NK + IL - 2 Receptor gamma Chain Mutation : a Challenging Diagnosis of Atypical Severe Combined Immunodeficiency .|PURPOSE : All reported patients with hypomorphic X - linked severe combined immunodeficiency ( X - SCID ) due to c . 664C > T ( p . R222C ) mutations in the gene ( IL2RG ) encoding the common gamma chain ( gammac ) have presented with opportunistic infections within the first year of life , despite the presence of nearly normal NK and T cell numbers .|Reporting five children of one extended family with hemizygous mutations in IL2RG , we explore potential diagnostic clues and extend our comprehension of the functional impact of this mutation .|METHODS : Whole exome sequencing ( WES ) ; detailed immune phenotyping ; cytokine - induced STAT phosphorylation ; B , T , and NK cell activation ; and quantification of sjTRECs in five Arab children with c . 664C > T ( p . R222C ) IL2RG mutation .|RESULTS : The mean age at clinical presentation with respiratory tract infection or diarrhea was 6 . 8 ( range : 2 - 12 ) months .|None of the children presented with opportunistic infections .|Diagnostic clues were early onset in the first year of life , and a suggestive family history associated with reduced naive CD4 T cells and absent switched memory B cells .|Number and phenotype of NK cells and innate - like lymphocytes were normal .|The diagnosis was made by WES and corroborated by absent STAT phosphorylation and reduced functional response after IL - 2 and IL - 21 stimulation .|Four patients underwent successful hematopoietic stem cell transplantation .|CONCLUSIONS : As early diagnosis and treatment are important , a high index of suspicion in the diagnosis of c . 664C > T ( p . R222C ) X - SCID is needed .|This requires prompt genetic testing by next generation sequencing in order to avoid unnecessary delays in the definite diagnosis since immunological work up may not be discriminating .|Assays directly testing cytokine signaling or cytokine - dependent functions are helpful in confirming the functional impact of the identified hypomorphic variants .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	41-46	18-20	rs111033618	c . 664C > T|p .

His352Arg ) .|Our patient had hypogammaglobulinaemia with a small number of B cells , most of which were naive .|The most noteworthy findings included marked skewing towards a Th1 phenotype in peripheral blood T cells and excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines ( IL - 1beta , TNFalpha ) .|The patient 's 6 - year - old daughter , a carrier of the NFKB1 mutation , is clinically asymptomatic , but has started to show cellular and molecular changes .|This case of NFKB1 deficiency appears to be a combination of immunodeficiency and a hyperinflammatory state .|The current situation of the patient 's daughter provides a glimpse of the preclinical phase of the condition .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	159-162	110-111	rs5743272	p .

30071009	Transforming growth factor - beta1 gene promoter - 509C / T polymorphism in association with expression affects colorectal cancer development and depends on gender .|It is widely known that sporadic colorectal cancer ( CRC ) is age - related diseases with higher incidence rate among men .|Transforming growth factor - beta1 ( TGF - beta1 ) is a major immune regulatory cytokine with a great impact and dual role in gastrointestinal carcinogenesis .|In this context , the aim of the study was to explore the role of circulating TGF - beta1 and the - 509C / T functional promoter polymorphism ( rs1800469 ) within the TGF - beta1 gene ( TGFB1 ) in the susceptibility , progression , and prognosis of CRC among Bulgarian male and female patients .|Patients with sporadic CRC and healthy controls were genotyped by polymerase - chain reaction - restriction fragment length polymorphism .|Serum TGF - beta1 levels before and after curative surgery were determined by ELISA .|Total RNA was extracted from paired tumor , normal mucosa and distant metastasis samples and was used for quantitative detection of TGFB1 mRNA by TaqMan qPCR . We observed that TGF - beta1 serum levels depend on the - 509C / T genotype in combination with gender .|TGF - beta1 serum levels in CRC patients were decreased compared to controls , but statistical significance was reached only for men .|In the stratified analysis by gender and genotype , a significant association was found for the CC genotype .|Overall , our results indicate that the - 509C allele increased the cancer risk , particularly for advanced stages ( OR = 1 . 477 ; p = 0 . 029 ) .|The results from the relative mRNA quantification showed a significant upregulation of TGFB1 in distant metastases compared to primary tumor tissues and higher TGFB1 mRNA levels in men ( RQ = 4 . 959 ; p = 0 . 022 ) .|In conclusion , we present data that diminished circulating TGF - beta1 due to the CC genotype could be a possible risk factor for tumor susceptibility and progression .|This association is more pronounced in males than in females .|Colorectal cancer tissue expression of TGFB1 gene mRNA correlates with tumor progression and metastasis .	1:VDA:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	7-11	17-19	rs1800469	- 509C / T|- 509C / T|rs1800469|- 509C / T|- 509C	DNAMutation	7:96:104:205:264	11:100:105:209:266	0:3:3:6:9	D015179	colorectal cancer|colorectal cancer|CRC|CRC|CRC|CRC|Colorectal cancer	Disease	17:31:34:124:135:221:372	19:33:35:125:136:222:374	0:1:1:3:4:7:13	7040	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	72-74	96-100	rs1800469	- 509C / T|- 509C / T|rs1800469|- 509C / T|- 509C	DNAMutation	7:96:104:205:264	11:100:105:209:266	0:3:3:6:9	D063646	gastrointestinal carcinogenesis	Disease	72	74	2	7040	None	1:NR:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	264-266	269-270	rs1800469	- 509C / T|- 509C / T|rs1800469|- 509C / T|- 509C	DNAMutation	7:96:104:205:264	11:100:105:209:266	0:3:3:6:9	D009369	tumor|cancer|tumor|tumor|tumor	Disease	173:269:309:356:382	174:270:310:357:383	6:9:10:11:13	7040	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	264-266	305-306	rs1800469	- 509C / T|- 509C / T|rs1800469|- 509C / T|- 509C	DNAMutation	7:96:104:205:264	11:100:105:209:266	0:3:3:6:9	D009362	metastases	Disease	305	306	10	7040	None
30089727	Cardiovascular consequences of KATP overactivity in Cantu syndrome .|Cantu syndrome ( CS ) is characterized by multiple vascular and cardiac abnormalities including vascular dilation and tortuosity , systemic hypotension , and cardiomegaly .|The disorder is caused by gain - of - function ( GOF ) mutations in genes encoding pore - forming ( Kir6 . 1 , KCNJ8 ) and accessory ( SUR2 , ABCC9 ) ATP - sensitive potassium ( KATP ) channel subunits .|However , there is little understanding of the link between molecular dysfunction and the complex pathophysiology observed , and there is no known treatment , in large part due to the lack of appropriate preclinical disease models in which to test therapies .|Notably , expression of Kir6 . 1 and SUR2 does not fully overlap , and the relative contribution of KATP GOF in various cardiovascular tissues remains to be elucidated .|To investigate pathophysiologic mechanisms in CS we have used CRISPR / Cas9 engineering to introduce CS - associated SUR2 [ A478V ] and Kir6 . 1 [ V65M ] mutations to the equivalent endogenous loci in mice .|Mirroring human CS , both of these animals exhibit low systemic blood pressure and dilated , compliant blood vessels , as well dramatic cardiac enlargement , the effects being more severe in V65M animals than in A478V animals .|In both animals , whole - cell patch - clamp recordings reveal enhanced basal KATP conductance in vascular smooth muscle , explaining vasodilation and lower blood pressure , and demonstrating a cardinal role for smooth muscle KATP dysfunction in CS etiology .|Echocardiography confirms in situ cardiac enlargement and increased cardiac output in both animals .|Patch - clamp recordings reveal reduced ATP sensitivity of ventricular myocyte KATP channels in A478V , but normal ATP sensitivity in V65M , suggesting that cardiac remodeling occurs secondary to KATP overactivity outside of the heart .|These SUR2 [ A478V ] and Kir6 . 1 [ V65M ] animals thus reiterate the key cardiovascular features seen in human CS .|They establish the molecular basis of the pathophysiological consequences of reduced smooth muscle excitability resulting from SUR2 / Kir6 . 1 -

30098094	Prevalence and phenotype of the c . 1529C > T SPG7 variant in adult - onset cerebellar ataxia in Italy .|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE : Hereditary ataxias are heterogeneous groups of neurodegenerative disorders , characterized by cerebellar syndromes associated with dysarthria , oculomotor and corticospinal signs , neuropathy and cognitive impairment .|Recent reports have suggested mutations in the SPG7 gene , causing the most common form of autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia ( MIM # 607259 ) , as a main cause of ataxias .|The majority of described patients were homozygotes or compound heterozygotes for the c . 1529C > T ( p . Ala510Val ) change .|We screened a cohort of 895 Italian patients with ataxia for p . Ala510Val in order to define the prevalence and genotype - phenotype correlation of this variant .|METHODS : We set up a rapid assay for c . 1529C > T using restriction enzyme analysis after polymerase chain reaction amplification .|We confirmed the diagnosis with Sanger sequencing .|RESULTS : We identified eight homozygotes and 13 compound heterozygotes , including two novel variants affecting splicing .|Mutated patients showed a pure cerebellar ataxia at onset , evolving in mild spastic ataxia ( alternatively ) associated with dysarthria ( ~80 % of patients ) , urinary urgency ( ~30 % ) and pyramidal signs ( ~70 % ) .|Comparing homozygotes and compound heterozygotes , we noted a difference in age at onset and Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia score between the two groups , supporting an earlier and more severe phenotype in compound heterozygotes versus homozygotes .|CONCLUSIONS : The SPG7 c . 1529C > T ( p .

30287322	More than keratitis , ichthyosis , and deafness : Multisystem effects of lethal GJB2 mutations .|BACKGROUND : Infant death in keratitis - ichthyosis - deafness ( KID ) syndrome is recognized ; its association with specific genotypes and pathophysiology is inadequately understood .|OBJECTIVE : We sought to discover characteristics that account for poor outcomes in lethal KID syndrome .|METHODS : We collected 4 new cases and 9 previously reported , genotyped cases of lethal KID syndrome .|We performed new molecular modeling of the lethal mutants GJB2 p . A88V and GJB2 p . G45E .|RESULTS : Infant death occurred in all patients with GJB2 p . G45E and p . A88V ; it is unusual with other GJB2 mutations .|Early death with those 2 " lethal " mutations is likely multifactorial : during life all had > = 1 serious infection ; most had poor weight gain and severe respiratory difficulties ; many had additional anatomic abnormalities .|Structural modeling of GJB2 p . G45E identified no impact on the salt bridge previously predicted to account for abnormal central carbon dioxide sensing of GJB2 p . A88V .|LIMITATIONS : This clinical review was retrospective .|CONCLUSION : GJB2 p . G45E and p . A88V are the only KID syndrome mutations associated with uniform early lethality .|Those electrophysiologically severe mutations in GJB2 reveal abnormalities in many organs in lethal KID syndrome .|All patients with KID syndrome may have subtle abnormalities beyond the eyes , ears , and skin .|Early genotyping of KID syndrome births will inform prognostic discussion .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	95-98	2-3	rs72561723	p .

31261387	Functionalization of the TMEM175 p . M393T variant as a risk factor for Parkinson disease .|Multiple genome - wide association studies ( GWAS ) in Parkinson disease ( PD ) have identified a signal at chromosome 4p16 . 3 ; however , the causal variant has not been established for this locus .|Deep investigation of the region resulted in one identified variant , the rs34311866 missense SNP ( p . M393T ) in TMEM175 , which is 20 orders of magnitude more significant than any other SNP in the region .|Because TMEM175 is a lysosomal gene that has been shown to influence alpha - synuclein phosphorylation and autophagy , the p . M393T variant is an attractive candidate , and we have examined its effect on TMEM175 protein and PD - related biology .|After knocking down each of the genes located under the GWAS peak via multiple shRNAs , only TMEM175 was found to consistently influence accumulation of phosphorylated alpha - synuclein ( p - alpha - syn ) .|Examination of the p . M393T variant showed effects on TMEM175 function that were intermediate between the wild - type ( WT ) and knockout phenotypes , with reduced regulation of lysosomal pH in response to starvation and minor changes in clearance of autophagy substrates , reduced lysosomal localization , and increased accumulation of p - alpha - syn .|Finally , overexpression of WT TMEM175 protein reduced p - alpha - syn , while overexpression of the p . M393T variant resulted in no change in alpha - synuclein phosphorylation .|These results suggest that the main signal in the chromosome 4p16 . 3 PD risk locus is driven by the TMEM175 p . M393T variant .|Modulation of TMEM175 may impact alpha - synuclein biology and therefore may be a rational therapeutic strategy for PD .	1:VDA:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	4-7	13-15	rs34311866	p .

31455383	P53 - R273H mutation enhances colorectal cancer stemness through regulating specific lncRNAs .|BACKGROUND : TP53 is one of the most frequently mutated genes among all cancer types , and TP53 mutants occur more than 60 % in colorectal cancer ( CRC ) .|Among all mutants , there are three hot spots , including p53 - R175H , p53 - R248W and p53 - R273H .|Emerging evidence attributes cancer carcinogenesis to cancer stem cells ( CSCs ) .|Long noncoding RNAs ( lncRNAs ) play crucial roles in maintaining the stemness of CSCs .|However , it is unknown if mutant p53 - regulated lncRNAs are implicated in the maintenance of CSC stemness .|METHODS : RNA - sequencing ( RNA - seq ) and ChIP - sequencing ( ChIP - seq ) were used to trace the lncRNA network regulated by p53 - R273H in HCT116 endogenous p53 point mutant spheroid cells generated by the somatic cell knock - in method .|RT - qPCR was used to detect lncRNA expression patterns , verifying the bioinformatics analysis .|Transwell , spheroid formation , fluorescence activated cell sorter ( FACS ) , xenograft nude mouse model , tumor frequency assessed by extreme limiting dilution analysis ( ELDA ) , Western blot assays and chemoresistance analysis were performed to elucidate the functions and possible mechanism of lnc273 - 31 and lnc273 - 34 in cancer stem cells .|RESULTS : p53 - R273H exhibited more characteristics of CSC than p53 - R175H and p53 - R248W .|RNA - seq profiling identified 37 up regulated and 4 down regulated differentially expressed lncRNAs regulated by p53 - R273H .|Combined with ChIP - seq profiling , we further verified two lncRNAs , named as lnc273 - 31 and lnc273 - 34 , were essential in the maintenance of CSC stemness .|Further investigation illustrated that lnc273 - 31 or lnc273 - 34 depletion dramatically diminished colorectal cancer migration , invasion , cancer stem cell self - renewal and chemoresistance in vitro .|Moreover , the absence of lnc273 - 31 or lnc273 - 34 dramatically delayed cancer initiation and tumorigenic cell frequency in vivo .|Also , lnc273 - 31 and lnc273 - 34 have an impact on epithelial - to mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) .|Finally , lnc273 - 31 and lnc273 - 34 were significantly highly expressed in CRC tissues with p53 - R273H mutation compared to those with wildtype p53 .|CONCLUSIONS : The present study unveiled a high - confidence set of lncRNAs regulated by p53 - R273H specific in colorectal CSCs .|Furthermore , we demonstrated that two of them , lnc273 - 31 and lnc273 - 34 , were required for colorectal CSC self - renewal , tumor propagation and chemoresistance .|Also , the expression of these two lncRNAs augmented in colorectal cancer patient samples with p53 - R273H mutation .|These two lncRNAs may serve as promising predictors for patients with p53 - R273H mutation and are vital for chemotherapy .	1:VDA:2	L2R	NON-CROSS	2-3	5-8	rs28934576	R273H|R273H|R273H|R273H|R273H|R273H|R273H|R273H|R273H	ProteinMutation	2:65:146:243:277:406:432:486:502	3:66:147:244:278:407:433:487:503	0:2:6:9:10:15:16:18:19	D015179	colorectal cancer stemness|colorectal cancer|CRC|colorectal cancer|CRC|colorectal cancer	Disease	5:38:41:325:401:479	8:40:42:327:402:481	0:1:1:12:15:18	7157	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	65-66	73-74	rs28934576	R273H|R273H|R273H|R273H|R273H|R273H|R273H|R273H|R273H	ProteinMutation	2:65:146:243:277:406:432:486:502	3:66:147:244:278:407:433:487:503	0:2:6:9:10:15:16:18:19	D009369	cancer|cancer|tumor|cancer|cancer|cancer|tumor	Disease	26:73:199:235:331:356:464	27:74:200:236:332:357:465	1:3:8:8:12:13:17	7157	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	65-66	70-72	rs28934576	R273H|R273H|R273H|R273H|R273H|R273H|R273H|R273H|R273H	ProteinMutation	2:65:146:243:277:406:432:486:502	3:66:147:244:278:407:433:487:503	0:2:6:9:10:15:16:18:19	D063646	cancer carcinogenesis	Disease	70	72	3	7157	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	57-58	41-42	rs28934578	R175H|R175H	ProteinMutation	57:252	58:253	2:9	D015179	colorectal cancer stemness|colorectal cancer|CRC|colorectal cancer|CRC|colorectal cancer	Disease	5:38:41:325:401:479	8:40:42:327:402:481	0:1:1:12:15:18	7157	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	61-62	41-42	rs121912651	R248W|R248W	ProteinMutation	61:256	62:257	2:9	D015179	colorectal cancer stemness|colorectal cancer|CRC|colorectal cancer|CRC|colorectal cancer	Disease	5:38:41:325:401:479	8:40:42:327:402:481	0:1:1:12:15:18	7157	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	73-74	57-58	rs28934578	R175H|R175H	ProteinMutation	57:252	58:253	2:9	D009369	cancer|cancer|tumor|cancer|cancer|cancer|tumor	Disease	26:73:199:235:331:356:464	27:74:200:236:332:357:465	1:3:8:8:12:13:17	7157	None	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	73-74	61-62	rs121912651	R248W|R248W	ProteinMutation	61:256	62:257	2:9	D009369	cancer|cancer|tumor|cancer|cancer|cancer|tumor	Disease	26:73:199:235:331:356:464	27:74:200:236:332:357:465	1:3:8:8:12:13:17	7157	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	57-58	70-72	rs28934578	R175H|R175H	ProteinMutation	57:252	58:253	2:9	D063646	cancer carcinogenesis	Disease	70	72	3	7157	None	1:NR:2	L2R	CROSS	61-62	70-72	rs121912651	R248W|R248W	ProteinMutation	61:256	62:257	2:9	D063646	cancer carcinogenesis	Disease	70	72	3	7157	None
31456518	Identification of Phosphorylation Associated SNPs for Blood Pressure , Coronary Artery Disease and Stroke from Genome - wide Association Studies .|PURPOSE : Phosphorylation - related SNP ( phosSNP ) is a non - synonymous SNP that might influence protein phosphorylation status .|The aim of this study was to assess the effect of phosSNPs on blood pressure ( BP ) , coronary artery disease ( CAD ) and ischemic stroke ( IS ) .|METHODS : We examined the association of phosSNPs with BP , CAD and IS in shared data from genome - wide association studies ( GWAS ) and tested if the disease loci were enriched with phosSNPs .|Furthermore , we performed quantitative trait locus analysis to find out if the identified phosSNPs have impacts on gene expression , protein and metabolite levels .|RESULTS : We found numerous phosSNPs for systolic BP ( count = 148 ) , diastolic BP ( count = 206 ) , CAD ( count = 20 ) and IS ( count = 4 ) .|The most significant phosSNPs for SBP , DBP , CAD and IS were rs1801131 in MTHFR , rs3184504 in SH2B3 , rs35212307 in WDR12 and rs3184504 in SH2B3 , respectively .|Our analyses revealed that the associated SNPs identified by the original GWAS were significantly enriched with phosSNPs and many well - known genes predisposing to cardiovascular diseases contain significant phosSNPs .|We found that BP , CAD and IS shared for phosSNPs in loci that contain functional genes involve in cardiovascular diseases , e . g . , rs11556924 ( ZC3HC1 ) , rs1971819 ( ICA1L ) , rs3184504 ( SH2B3 ) , rs3739998 ( JCAD ) , rs903160 ( SMG6 ) .|Four phosSNPs in ADAMTS7 were significantly associated with CAD , including the known functional SNP rs3825807 .|Moreover , the identified phosSNPs seemed to have the potential to affect transcription regulation and serum levels of numerous cardiovascular diseases - related proteins and metabolites .|CONCLUSION : The findings suggested that phosSNPs may play important roles in BP regulation and the pathological mechanisms of CAD and IS .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	188-189	184-185	rs1801131	rs1801131	SNP	188	189	6	D003324	Coronary Artery Disease|coronary artery

31500627	Enhancer variants associated with Alzheimer 's disease affect gene expression via chromatin looping .|BACKGROUND : Genome - wide association studies ( GWASs ) have identified single - nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) that may be genetic factors underlying Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) .|However , how these AD - associated SNPs ( AD SNPs ) contribute to the pathogenesis of this disease is poorly understood because most of them are located in non - coding regions , such as introns and intergenic regions .|Previous studies reported that some disease - associated SNPs affect regulatory elements including enhancers .|We hypothesized that non - coding AD SNPs are located in enhancers and affect gene expression levels via chromatin loops .|METHODS : To characterize AD SNPs within non - coding regions , we extracted 406 AD SNPs with GWAS p - values of less than 1 . 00 x 10 - 6 from the GWAS catalog database .|Of these , we selected 392 SNPs within non - coding regions .|Next , we checked whether those non - coding AD SNPs were located in enhancers that typically regulate gene expression levels using publicly available data for enhancers that were predicted in 127 human tissues or cell types .|We sought expression quantitative trait locus ( eQTL ) genes affected by non - coding AD SNPs within enhancers because enhancers are regulatory elements that influence the gene expression levels .|To elucidate how the non - coding AD SNPs within enhancers affect the gene expression levels , we identified chromatin - chromatin interactions by Hi - C experiments .|RESULTS : We report the following findings : ( 1 ) nearly 30 % of non - coding AD SNPs are located in enhancers ; ( 2 ) eQTL genes affected by non - coding AD SNPs within enhancers are associated with amyloid beta clearance , synaptic transmission , and immune responses ; ( 3 ) 95 % of the AD SNPs located in enhancers co - localize with their eQTL genes in topologically associating domains suggesting that regulation may occur through chromatin higher - order structures ; ( 4 ) rs1476679 spatially contacts the promoters of eQTL genes via CTCF - CTCF interactions ; ( 5 ) the effect of other AD SNPs such as rs7364180 is likely to be , at least in part , indirect through regulation of transcription factors that in turn regulate AD associated genes .|CONCLUSION : Our results suggest that non - coding AD SNPs may affect the function of enhancers thereby influencing the expression levels of surrounding or distant genes via chromatin loops .|This result may explain how some non - coding AD SNPs contribute to AD pathogenesis .	1:VDA:2	R2L	CROSS	363-364	39-42	rs1476679	rs1476679	SNP	363	364	10	D000544	Alzheimer 's disease|Alzheimer 's disease	Disease	4:39	7:42	0:1	None	None	1:VDA:2	R2L	CROSS	388-389	39-42	rs7364180	rs7364180	SNP	388	389	10	D000544	Alzheimer 's disease|Alzheimer 's disease	Disease	4:39	7:42	0:1	None	None

Arg37Pro ) pathogenic variant in homozygous or compound heterozygous state .|In this study , we analyzed a peripheral neuropathy caused by pathogenic variants in the HINT1 gene and evaluated its contribution to the hereditary neuropathy structure .|The studied group included 1596 non - related families diagnosed with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy ( HMSN ) .|The results show that HINT1 gene pathogenic variants make a significant contribution to the hereditary neuropathy epidemiology in Russian patients .|They account for at least 1 . 9 % of all HMSN cases and 9 % of axonopathy cases .|The most common HINT1 pathogenic variant in Russian patients is the c . 110G > C ( p . Arg37Pro ) substitution .|Its allelic frequency is 0 . 2 % ( 95 % CI 0 . 19 - 0 . 21 % ) , carrier frequency is 1 in 250 people in Russian Federation , and the estimated disease incidence is 1 in 234 , 000 individuals .|It was determined that the cause of this pathogenic variant 's prevalence is the founder effect .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	188-193	168-169	rs149782619	c . 110G > C|p .
